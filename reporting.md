.# Abstract

A number of protocols exist for establishing encrypted channels between SMTP
Mail Transfer Agents, including STARTTLS [@?RFC3207], DANE [@!RFC6698], and
MTA-STS (TODO: Add ref). These protocols can fail due to misconfiguration or
active attack, leading to undelivered messages or delivery over unencrypted or
unauthenticated channels. This document describes a reporting mechanism and
format by which sending systems can share statistics and specific information
about potential failures with recipient domains. Recipient domains can then use
this information to both detect potential attackers and diagnose unintentional
misconfigurations.

{mainmatter}

# Introduction

The STARTTLS extension to SMTP [@?RFC3207] allows SMTP clients and hosts to
establish secure SMTP sessions over TLS. The protocol design is based on
"Opportunistic Security" (OS) [@?RFC7435], which maintains interoperability with
clients that do not support STARTTLS but means that any attacker who can delete
parts of the SMTP session (such as the "250 STARTTLS" response) or redirect the
entire SMTP session (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record of the
delivery domain) can perform a downgrade or interception attack.

Because such "downgrade attacks" are not necessarily apparent to the receiving
MTA, this document defines a mechanism for sending domains to report on failures
at multiple stages of the MTA-to-MTA conversation.

Recipient domains may also use the mechanisms defined by MTA-STS (TODO: Add ref)
or DANE [@!RFC6698] to publish additional encryption and authentication
requirements; this document defines a mechanism for sending domains that are
compatible with MTA-STS or DANE to share success and failure statistics with
recipient domains.

Specifically, this document defines a reporting schema that covers failures in
routing, STARTTLS negotiation, and both DANE [@!RFC6698] and MTA-STS (TODO: Add
ref) policy validation errors, and a standard TXT record that recipient domains
can use to indicate where reports in this format should be sent.

This document is intended as a companion to the specification for SMTP MTA
Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS, TODO: Add ref).

## Terminology

The keywords **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**,
**SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL**, when
they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in [@!RFC2119].

We also define the following terms for further use in this document:

* MTA-STS Policy: A definition of the expected TLS availability, behavior, and
  desired actions for a given domain when a sending MTA encounters
  problems in negotiating a secure channel. MTA-STS is defined in [TODO]
* DANE Policy: A mechanism by which administrators can supply a record that can
  be used to validate the certificate presented by an MTA. DANE is defined
  in [@!RFC6698].
* TLSRPT Policy: A policy specifying the endpoint to which sending MTAs should
  deliver reports.
* Policy Domain: The domain against which an MTA-STS or DANE Policy is defined.
* Sending MTA: The MTA initiating the delivery of an email message.

# Reporting Policy

A domain publishes a record to its DNS indicating that it wishes to
receive reports. These SMTP TLSRPT policies are distributed via DNS from the
Policy Domain's zone, as TXT records (similar to DMARC policies) under the name
`_smtp-tlsrpt`. For example, for the Policy Domain `example.com`, the
recipient's TLSRPT policy can be retrieved from `_smtp-tlsrpt.example.com`.

Policies consist of the following directives:

* `v`: This value MUST be equal to `TLSRPTv1`.
* `rua`: A URI specifying the endpoint to which aggregate information about
  policy validation results should be sent (see (#reporting-schema), "Reporting 
  Schema",  for more information). Two URI schemes are supported: `mailto` 
  and `https`.  As with DMARC [@?RFC7489], the policy domain can specify a 
  comma-separated list of URIs.
* In the case of `https`, reports should be submitted via POST ([@!RFC2818]) 
  to the specified URI.  Report submitters MAY ignore certificate validation
  errors when submitting reports via https.
* In the case of `mailto`, reports should be submitted to the specified
  email address ([@!RFC6068]). When sending failure reports via SMTP,
	sending MTAs MUST deliver reports despite any TLS-related failures.
	This may mean that the reports are delivered in the clear.  Additionally,
	 reports sent via SMTP MUST contain a valid DKIM [@!RFC6376] signature by
	 the reporting domain.  Reports lacking such a signature MUST be ignored
	 by the recipient.  DKIM signatures must not use the "l=" attribute to
	 limit the body length used in the signature.

The formal definition of the `_smtp-tlsrpt` TXT record, defined using
[@!RFC5234] & [@!RFC7405], is as follows:

        tlsrpt-record     = tlsrpt-version 1*(field-delim tlsrpt-field)
                            [field-delim]

        field-delim       = *WSP ";" *WSP

        tlsrpt-field      = tlsrpt-rua /        ; Note that the tlsrpt-rua
                            tlsrpt-extension    ; record is required.

        tlsrpt-version    = %s"v=TLSRPTv1"

        tlsrpt-rua        = %s"rua="
	                    tlsrpt-uri *(*WSP "," *WSP tlsrpt-uri)

        tlsrpt-uri        = URI
                          ; "URI" is imported from [@!RFC3986]; commas (ASCII
                          ; 0x2C) and exclamation points (ASCII 0x21)
                          ; MUST be encoded

        tlsrpt-extension  = tlsrpt-ext-name "=" tlsrpt-ext-value

        tlsrpt-ext-name   = (ALPHA / DIGIT) *31(ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" / "-" / ".")

        tlsrpt-ext-value  = 1*(%x21-3A / %x3C / %x3E-7E)       ; chars excluding
                                                         ; "=", ";", SP, and
                                                         ; control chars


If multiple TXT records for `_smtp-tlsrpt` are returned by the resolver, records
which do not begin with `v=TLSRPTv1;` are discarded. If the number of resulting
records is not one, senders MUST assume the recipient domain does not implement
TLSRPT. If the resulting TXT record contains multiple strings, then the record
MUST be treated as if those strings are concatenated together without adding
spaces.

Parsers MUST accept TXT records which are syntactically valid (i.e.
valid key-value pairs separated by semi-colons) and implementing a superset of
this specification, in which case unknown fields SHALL be ignored.

## Example Reporting Policy

### Report using MAILTO

```
_smtp-tlsrpt.example.com. IN TXT \
	"v=TLSRPTv1;rua=mailto:reports@example.com"
```

### Report using HTTPS

```
_smtp-tlsrpt.example.com. IN TXT \
	"v=TLSRPTv1; \
	rua=https://reporting.example.com/v1/tlsrpt"
```

# Reporting Schema

The report is composed as a plain text file encoded in the I-JSON format
([@!RFC7493]).

Aggregate reports contain the following fields:

* Report metadata:
  * The organization responsible for the report
  * Contact information for one or more responsible parties for the
    contents of the report
  * A unique identifier for the report
  * The reporting date range for the report
* Policy, consisting of:
  * One of the following policy types:
    (1) The MTA-STS policy applied (as a string)
    (2) The DANE TLSA record applied (as a string, with each RR entry of the
    RRset listed and separated by a semicolon)
    (3) The literal string `no-policy-found`, if neither a DANE nor
    MTA-STS policy could be found.
  * The domain for which the policy is applied
  * The MX host
  * An identifier for the policy (where applicable)
* Aggregate counts, comprising result type, sending MTA IP, receiving MTA
  hostname, session count, and an optional additional information field
  containing a URI for recipients to review further information on a failure
  type.

Note that the failure types are non-exclusive; an aggregate report may contain
overlapping `counts` of failure types when a single send attempt encountered
multiple errors.

## Report Time-frame

The report SHOULD cover a full day, from 0000-2400 UTC.  This should allow for
easier correlation of failure events.  To avoid a Denial of Service against the
system processing the reports, the reports should be delivered after some
delay, perhaps several hours.

## Delivery Summary

### Success Count

* `success-count`: This indicates that the sending MTA was able to successfully
  negotiate a policy-compliant TLS connection, and serves to provide a
  "heartbeat" to receiving domains that reporting is functional and tabulating
  correctly.  This field contains an aggregate count of successful connections
  for the reporting system.
    
### Failure Count

* `failure-count`: This indicates that the sending MTA was unable to
  successfully establish a connection with the receiving platform.
  (#result-types), "Result Types", will elaborate on the failed negotiation
  attempts.  This field contains an aggregate count of failed connections.

## Result Types

The list of result types will start with the minimal set below, and is expected
to grow over time based on real-world experience. The initial set is:

### Negotiation Failures

* `starttls-not-supported`: This indicates that the recipient MX did not
    support STARTTLS.
* `certificate-host-mismatch`: This indicates that the certificate presented
    did not adhere to the constraints specified in the MTA-STS or DANE policy, e.g.
    if the MX does not match any identities listed in the Subject Alternate 
    Name (SAN) [RFC5280].
* `certificate-expired`: This indicates that the certificate has expired.
* `certificate-not-trusted`: This a label that covers multiple certificate
    related failures that include, but not limited to errors such as
    untrusted/unknown CAs, certificate name constraints, certificate chain
    errors etc. When using this declaration, the reporting MTA SHOULD utilize
    the `failure-reason` to provide more information to the receiving entity.
* `validation-failure`: This indicates a general failure for a reason not matching 
    a category above.  When using this declaration, the reporting MTA SHOULD utilize 
    the `failure-reason` to provide more information to the receiving entity.

### Policy Failures

#### DANE-specific Policy Failures

* `tlsa-invalid`: This indicates a validation error in the TLSA record
    associated with a DANE policy.  None of the records in the RRset were found
    to be valid.
* `dnssec-invalid`: This would indicate that no valid records were returned from 
    the recursive resolver.  The request returned with SERVFAIL for the requested
    TLSA record.  It should be noted that if the reporter's systems are having problems
    resolving destination DNS records due to DNSSEC failures, it's possible they will 
    also be unable to resolve the TLSRPT record, therefore these types of reports may
    be rare.

#### MTA-STS-specific Policy Failures

* `sts-policy-invalid`: This indicates a validation error for the overall MTA-STS
    policy.
* `sts-webpki-invalid`: This indicates that the MTA-STS policy could not be
    authenticated using PKIX validation.
    
### General Failures

When a negotiation failure can not be categorized into one of the "Negotiation Failures" 
stated above, the reporter SHOULD use the `validation-failure` category.  As TLS grows
and becomes more complex, new mechanisms may not be easily categorized.  This allows for
a generic feedback category.  When this category is used, the reporter SHOULD also use the
`failure-reason-code` to give some feedback to the receiving entity.  This is intended
to be a short text field, and the contents of the field should be an error code or error
text, such as "X509_V_ERR_UNHANDLED_CRITICAL_CRL_EXTENSION".

### Transient Failures

Transient errors due to too-busy network, TCP timeouts, etc. are not required to be reported. 

## JSON Report Schema

The JSON schema is derived from the HPKP JSON schema [@?RFC7469] (cf. Section 3)

```

Figure: JSON Report Format

* `organization-name`: The name of the organization responsible for the
    report. It is provided as a string.
* `date-time`: The date-time indicates the start- and end-times for the report
    range. It is provided as a string formatted according to Section 5.6,
    "Internet Date/Time Format", of [@!RFC3339].  The report should be for a
    full UTC day, 0000-2400.
* `email-address`: The contact information for a responsible party of the
    report. It is provided as a string formatted according to Section 3.4.1,
    "Addr-Spec", of [@!RFC5321].
* `report-id`: A unique identifier for the report. Report authors may use
    whatever scheme they prefer to generate a unique identifier. It is provided
    as a string.
* `policy-type`: The type of policy that was applied by the sending domain.
    Presently, the only three valid choices are `tlsa`, `sts`, and the literal
    string `no-policy-found`. It is provided as a string.
* `policy-string`: A string representation of the policy, whether TLSA 
    record ([@!RFC6698] section 2.3) or MTA-STS policy. Examples:
    TLSA: `"_25._tcp.mx.example.com. IN TLSA ( 3 0 1 \
    1F850A337E6DB9C609C522D136A475638CC43E1ED424F8EEC8513D7 47D1D085D )"`

    mx2.example.com\nmx: mx.backup-example.com\nmax_age: 12345678"`
* `domain`: The Policy Domain is the domain against which the MTA-STS or DANE
    policy is defined. In the case of Internationalized Domain Names
    ([@?RFC5891]), the domain is the Punycode-encoded A-label
    ([@!RFC3492]) and not the U-label.
* `mx-host-pattern`: The pattern of MX hostnames from the applied policy. It
    is provided as a string, and is interpreted in the same manner as the
    "Checking of Wildcard Certificates" rules in Section 6.4.3 of [@!RFC6125].
    In the case of Internationalized Domain Names ([@!RFC5891]), the domain is 
    the Punycode-encoded A-label ([@!RFC3492]) and not the U-label.
* `result-type`: A value from (#result-types), "Result Types",  above.
* `ip-address`: The IP address of the sending MTA that attempted the STARTTLS
    connection. It is provided as a string representation of an IPv4 (see below) 
    or IPv6 ([@!RFC5952]) address in dot-decimal or colon-hexadecimal notation.
* `receiving-mx-hostname`: The hostname of the receiving MTA MX record with
    which the sending MTA attempted to negotiate a STARTTLS connection.
* `receiving-mx-helo`: (optional) The HELO or EHLO string from the banner
    announced during the reported session.
* `total-successful-session-count`: The aggregate number (integer) of successfully 
    negotiated TLS-enabled connections to the receiving site.
* `total-failure-session-count`: The aggregate number (integer) of failures to 
    negotiate an TLS-enabled connection to the receiving site.
* `failed-session-count`: The number of (attempted) sessions that match the relevant
    `result-type` for this section.
* `additional-info-uri`: An optional URI [@!RFC3986] pointing to additional information
    around the relevant `result-type`. For example, this URI might host the
    complete certificate chain presented during an attempted STARTTLS session.
* `failure-reason-code`: A text field to include an TLS-related error
    code or error message.
    
For report purposes, an IPv4 Address is defined as:
     IPv4address = dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet     
                   dec-octet     = DIGIT                 ; 0-9
                   / %x31-39 DIGIT         ; 10-99
                   / "1" 2DIGIT            ; 100-199
                   / "2" %x30-34 DIGIT     ; 200-249
                   / "25" %x30-35          ; 250-255
		    

# Report Delivery

Reports can be delivered either as an email message via SMTP or via HTTP
POST.

## Report Filename

The filename is RECOMMENDED to be constructed using the following ABNF:

     filename = sender "!" policy-domain "!" begin-timestamp
               "!" end-timestamp [ "!" unique-id ] "." extension

     unique-id = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT)

     sender = domain        ; From the [@!RFC5321] that is used 
     			    ; as the domain for the `contact-info`
			    ; address in the report body

     policy-domain   = domain

     begin-timestamp = 1*DIGIT
                     ; seconds since 00:00:00 UTC January 1, 1970
                     ; indicating start of the time range contained
                     ; in the report

     end-timestamp = 1*DIGIT
                     ; seconds since 00:00:00 UTC January 1, 1970
                     ; indicating end of the time range contained
                     ; in the report

     extension = "json" / "json.gz"

   The extension MUST be "json" for a plain JSON file, or "json.gz" for a
   JSON file compressed using GZIP.

   "unique-id" allows an optional unique ID generated by the Sending MTA to
   distinguish among multiple reports generated simultaneously by different
   sources within the same Policy Domain. For example, this is a possible
   filename for the gzip file of a report to the Policy Domain "example.net"
   from the Sending MTA "mail.sender.example.com":

     `mail.sender.example.com!example.net!1470013207!1470186007!001.json.gz`

## Compression

The report SHOULD be subjected to GZIP compression for both email and HTTPS
transport. Declining to apply compression can cause the report to be too large
for a receiver to process (a commonly observed receiver limit is ten megabytes);
compressing the file increases the chances of acceptance of the report at some
compute cost.

## Email Transport

The report MAY be delivered by email. To make the reports machine-parsable
for the receivers, we define a top-level media type `multipart/report` with
a new parameter `report-type="tlsrpt"`. Inside it, there are two parts: The
first part is human readable, typically `text/plain`, and the second part is
machine readable with a new media type defined called `application/tlsrpt+json`.
If compressed, the report should use the media type `application/tlsrpt+gzip`.

In addition, the following two new top level message header fields are defined:

```
TLS-Report-Domain: Receiver-Domain
TLS-Report-Submitter: Sender-Domain
```
The `TLS-Report-Submitter` value MUST match the value found in the filename
and the [@!RFC5321] domain from the `contact-info` from the report body.  These 
message headers MUST be included and should allow for easy searching for all
reports submitted by a report domain or a particular submitter, for example 
in IMAP [@?RFC3501]:

`s SEARCH HEADER "TLS-Report-Domain" "example.com"`

It is presumed that the aggregate reporting address will be equipped to process
new message header fields and extract MIME parts with the prescribed media type
and filename, and ignore the rest.  These additional headers SHOULD be included
in the DKIM [@!RFC6376] signature for the message.

   The [@!RFC5322].Subject field for report submissions SHOULD conform to the 
   following ABNF:

    tlsrpt-subject = %s"Report" FWS               ; "Report"
                     %s"Domain:" FWS              ; "Domain:"
		     domain-name FWS              ; per RFC6376
		     %s"Submitter:" FWS           ; "Submitter:"
		     domain-name FWS              ; per RFC6376
		     %s"Report-ID:" FWS           ; "Report-ID:
		     "<" id-left "@" id-right ">" ; per RFC5322
		     [CFWS]                       ; per RFC5322 (as with FWS)
    
   The first domain-name indicates the DNS domain name about which the
   report was generated.  The second domain-name indicates the DNS
   domain name representing the Sending MTA generating the report.
   The purpose of the Report-ID: portion of the field is to enable the
   Policy Domain to identify and ignore duplicate reports that might be
   sent by a Sending MTA.

   For instance, this is a possible Subject field for a report to the
   Policy Domain "example.net" from the Sending MTA
   "mail.sender.example.com".  It is line-wrapped as allowed by [@!RFC5322]:

     Subject: Report Domain: example.net
         Submitter: mail.sender.example.com
         Report-ID: <735ff.e317+bf22029@mailexample.net>

### Example Report 
```
 From: tlsrpt@mail.sender.example.com
     Date: Fri, May 09 2017 16:54:30 -0800
     To: mts-sts-tlsrpt@example.net
     Subject: Report Domain: example.net
         Submitter: mail.sender.example.com
         Report-ID: <735ff.e317+bf22029@example.net>
     TLS-Report-Domain: example.net
     TLS-Report-Submitter: mail.sender.example.com
     MIME-Version: 1.0
     Content-Type: multipart/report; report-type="tlsrpt";
         boundary="----=_NextPart_000_024E_01CC9B0A.AFE54C00"
     Content-Language: en-us

     This is a multipart message in MIME format.

     ------=_NextPart_000_024E_01CC9B0A.AFE54C00
     Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
     Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

     This is an aggregate TLS report from mail.sender.example.com

     ------=_NextPart_000_024E_01CC9B0A.AFE54C00
     Content-Type: application/tlsrpt+gzip
     Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
     Content-Disposition: attachment;
         filename="mail.sender.example!example.com!
                   1013662812!1013749130.gz"

     <gzipped content of report>

------=_NextPart_000_024E_01CC9B0A.AFE54C00--
...
```

Note that, when sending failure reports via SMTP, sending MTAs MUST NOT honor
MTA-STS or DANE TLSA failures.

## HTTPS Transport

The report MAY be delivered by POST to HTTPS. If compressed, the report SHOULD
use the media type `application/tlsrpt+gzip`, and `application/tlsrpt+json`
otherwise (see section (#iana-considerations), "IANA Considerations").

A reporting entity SHOULD expect a "successful" response from the accepting
HTTPS server, typically a 200 or 201 HTTP code [@?RFC7231].  Other codes could indicate
a delivery failure, and may be retried as per local policy.  The receiving system
is not expected to process reports at receipt time, and MAY store them for processing
at a later time.

## Delivery Retry

In the event of a delivery failure, regardless of the delivery method, a 
sender SHOULD attempt redelivery for up to 24hrs after the initial attempt.  As
previously stated the reports are optional, so while it is ideal to attempt
redelivery, it is not required.  If multiple retries are attempted, ideally they 
would be on a logarithmic scale.

## Metadata Variances

As stated above, there are a variable number of ways to declare information
about the data therein.  If it should be the case that these objects were to
disagree, then the report data contained within the JSON body MUST be considered 
the authoritative source for those data elements.

## STARTTLS Validation Result Types

This document creates a new registry, "STARTTLS Validation Result Types". The
initial entries in the registry are:

    +-------------------------------+
    | Result Type                   | 
    +-------------------------------+
    | "starttls-not-supported"      | 
    | "certificate-host-mismatch"   | 
    | "certificate-expired"         | 
    | "tlsa-invalid"                | 
    | "dnssec-invalid"              | 
    | "sts-policy-invalid"          | 
    | "sts-webpki-invalid"          | 
    | "validation-failure"          | 
    +-------------------------------+
   
The above entries are described in section (#result-types), "Result Types." New
result types can be added to this registry using "Expert Review" IANA 
registration policy.

# Security Considerations

SMTP TLS Reporting provides transparency into misconfigurations or attempts to
intercept or tamper with mail between hosts who support STARTTLS. There are
several security risks presented by the existence of this reporting channel:

* Flooding of the Aggregate report URI (rua) endpoint: An attacker could flood
  the endpoint with excessive reporting traffic and prevent the receiving domain
  from accepting additional reports. This type of Denial-of-Service attack would
  limit visibility into STARTTLS failures, leaving the receiving domain blind to
  an ongoing attack.

* Untrusted content: An attacker could inject malicious code into the report,
  opening a vulnerability in the receiving domain. Implementers are advised to
  take precautions against evaluating the contents of the report.

* Report snooping: An attacker could create a bogus TLSRPT record to receive
  statistics about a domain the attacker does not own. Since an attacker able to
  poison DNS is already able to receive counts of SMTP connections (and, absent
  DANE or MTA-STS policies, actual SMTP message payloads), this does not present
  a significant new vulnerability.

* Reports as DDoS: TLSRPT allows specifying destinations for the reports that
  are outside the authority of the Policy Domain, which allows domains to
  delegate processing of reports to a partner organization. However, an attacker
  who controls the Policy Domain DNS could also use this mechanism to direct the
  reports to an unwitting victim, flooding that victim with excessive reports.
  DMARC [@?RFC7489] defines a solution for verifying delegation to avoid such
  attacks; the need for this is greater with DMARC, however, because DMARC
  allows an attacker to trigger reports to a target from an innocent third party
  by sending that third party mail (which triggers a report from the third party
  to the target).  In the case of TLSRPT, the attacker would have to induce the 
  third party to send the attacker mail in order to trigger reports from the
  third party to the victim; this reduces the risk of such an attack and the
  need for a verification mechanism.
