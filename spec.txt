                     SMTP Strict Transport Security
                       draft-margolis-smtp-sts-00

Abstract

   SMTP STS is a mechanism enabling mail service providers to declare
   their ability to receive TLS-secured connections, to declare
   particular methods for certificate validation, and to request sending
   SMTP servers to report upon and/or refuse to deliver messages that
   cannot be delivered securely.

1.  Introduction

   The STARTTLS extension to SMTP [RFC3207] allows SMTP clients and
   hosts to establish secure SMTP sessions over TLS.  In its current
   form, however, it fails to provide (a) message confidentiality --



Margolis, et al.       Expires September 19, 2016               [Page 2]

Internet-Draft                  SMTP-STS                      March 2016


   because opportunistic STARTTLS is subject to downgrade attacks -- and
   (b) server authenticity -- because the trust relationship from email
   domain to MTA server identity is not cryptographically validated.

   While such "opportunistic" encryption protocols provide a high
   barrier against passive man-in-the-middle traffic interception, any
   attacker who can delete parts of the SMTP session (such as the "250
   STARTTLS" response) or who can redirect the entire SMTP session
   (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record of the delivery
   domain) can perform such a downgrade or interception attack.

   This document defines a mechanism for recipient domains to publish
   policies specifying:

   o  whether MTAs sending mail to this domain can expect TLS support

   o  how MTAs can validate the TLS server certificate presented during
      mail delivery

   o  what an implementing sender should do with messages when TLS
      cannot be be successfully negotiated

   The mechanism described is separated into four logical components:

   1.  policy semantics: whether senders can expect a server for the
       recipient domain to support TLS encryption and how to validate
       the TLS certificate presented

   2.  policy authentication: how to determine the authenticity of a
       published policy delivered via DNS

   3.  failure report format: a mechanism for informing recipient
       domains about aggregate failure statistics

   4.  failure handling: what sending MTAs should do in the case of
       policy failures

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   We also define the following terms for further use in this document:

   o  STS Policy: A definition of the expected TLS availability and
      behavior, as well as the desired actions for a given domain when a
      sending MTA encounters different results.



Margolis, et al.       Expires September 19, 2016               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  SMTP-STS                      March 2016


   o  Policy Domain: The domain against which an STS Policy is defined.

2.  Related Technologies

   The DANE TLSA record [RFC7672] is similar, in that DANE is also
   designed to upgrade opportunistic encryption into required
   encryption.  DANE requires DNSSEC [RFC4033] for the secure delivery
   of policies; the mechanism described here presents a variant for
   systems not yet supporting DNSSEC, and specifies a method for
   reporting TLS negotiation failures.

2.1.  Differences from DANE

   The primary difference between the mechanism described here and DANE
   is that DANE requires the use of DNSSEC to authenticate DANE TLSA
   records, whereas SMTP STS relies on the certificate authority (CA)
   system and a trust-on-first-use (TOFU) approach to avoid
   interception.  The TOFU model allows a degree of security similar to
   that of HPKP [RFC7469], reducing the complexity but without the
   guarantees on first use offered by DNSSEC.  (For a thorough
   discussion of this trade-off, see the section _Security_
   _Considerations_.)

   In addition, SMTP STS introduces a mechanism for failure reporting
   and a report-only mode, enabling progressive roll-out and auditing
   for compliance.

2.2.  Advantages When Used with DANE

   SMTP STS can be deployed for a recipient domain that also publishes a
   DANE TLSA record for SMTP.  In these cases, the SMTP STS policy can
   additionally declare a process for failure reporting.

2.3.  Advantages When Used Without DANE

   When deployed without a DANE TLSA record, SMTP STS offers the
   following advantages compared to DANE:

   o  _Infrastructure:_ In comparison to DANE, this proposal does not
      require DNSSEC be deployed on either the sending or receiving
      domain.  In addition, the reporting feature of SMTP STS can be
      deployed to perform offline analysis of STARTTLS failures,
      enabling mail providers to gain insight into the security of their
      SMTP connections without the need to modify MTA codebases
      directly.

   o  _Incrementalism:_ DANE does not provide a reporting mechanism and
      does not have a concept of "report-only" for failures; as a



Margolis, et al.       Expires September 19, 2016               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  SMTP-STS                      March 2016


      result, a service provider has no choice but to "flip the switch"
      and affect the entire mail stream at once.

2.4.  Disadvantages When Used Without DANE

   When deployed alone (i.e. without a DANE record, and using Web PKI
   for certificate verification), SMTP STS offers the following
   disadvantages compared to DANE:

   o  Infrastructure: DANE may be easier for some providers to deploy.
      In particular, for providers who already support DNSSEC, SMTP STS
      would additionally require they obtain a CA-signed x509
      certificate for the recipient domain.

   o  Security: DANE offers an advantage against policy-lookup DoS
      attacks; that is, while a DNSSEC-signed NX response to a DANE
      lookup authoritatively indicates the lack of a DANE record, such
      an option to authenticate policy non-existence does not exist when
      looking up a policy over plain DNS.

3.  Policy Semantics

   SMTP STS policies are distributed at the Policy Domain either through
   a new resource record, or as TXT records (similar to DMARC policies)
   under the name "_smtp_sts."  (Current implementations deploy as TXT
   records.)  For example, for the Policy Domain "example.com", the
   recipient's SMTP STS policy can be retrieved from
   "_smtp_sts.example.com."

   (Future implementations may move to alternate methods of policy
   discovery or distribution.  See the section _Future_ _Work_ for more
   discussion.)

   Policies MUST specify the following fields:

   o  v: Version (plain-text, required).  Currently only "STS1" is
      supported.

   o  to: TLS-Only (plain-text, required).  If "true," the receiving MTA
      requests that messages be delivered only if they conform to the
      STS policy.  If "false," the receiving MTA requests that failure
      reports be delivered, as specified by the "rua" parameter.

   o  mx: MX patterns (comma-separated list of plain-text MX match
      patterns, required).  One or more comma-separated patterns
      matching the expected MX for this domain.  For example,
      "_.example.com,_.example.net" indicates that mail for this domain




Margolis, et al.       Expires September 19, 2016               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  SMTP-STS                      March 2016


      might be handled by any MX whose hostname is a subdomain of
      "example.com" or "example.net."

   o  a: The mechanism to use to authenticate this policy itself.  See
      the section _Policy_ _Authentication_ for more details.  Possible
      values are:

      *  webpki:URI, where URI points to an HTTPS resource at the
         recipient domain that serves the same policy text.

      *  dnssec: Indicating that the policy is expected to be served
         over DNSSEC.

   o  c: Constraints on the recipient MX's TLS certificate (plain-text,
      required).  See the section _Policy_ _Validation_ for more
      details.  Possible values are:

      *  webpki: Indicating that the TLS certificate presented by the
         recipient MX will be validated according to the "web PKI"
         mechanism.

      *  tlsa: Indicating that the TLS certificate presented by the
         recipient MX will match a (presumed to exist) DANE TLSA record.

   o  e: Max lifetime of the policy (plain-text integer seconds).  Well-
      behaved clients SHOULD cache a policy for up to this value from
      last policy fetch time.

   o  rua: Address to which aggregate feedback MAY be sent (comma-
      separated plain-text list of email addresses, optional).  For
      example, "mailto:postmaster@example.com" from [RFC3986].

                      ; 0x2C) and exclamation points (ASCII 0x21)
                      ; MUST be encoded; the numeric portion MUST fit

   A size limitation in a sts-uri, if provided, is interpreted as a
   count of units followed by an OPTIONAL unit size ("k" for kilobytes,
   "m" for megabytes, "g" for gigabytes, "t" for terabytes).  Without a
   unit, the number is presumed to be a basic byte count.  Note that the
   units are considered to be powers of two; a kilobyte is 2^10, a
   megabyte is 2^20, etc.

3.2.  Policy Expirations

   In order to resist attackers inserting a fraudulent policy, SMTP STS
   policies are designed to be long-lived, with an expiry typically
   greater than two weeks.  Policy validity is controlled by two
   separate expiration times: the lifetime indicated in the policy
   ("e=") and the TTL on the DNS record itself.  The policy expiration
   will ordinarily be longer than that of the DNS TTL, and senders
   SHOULD cache a policy (and apply it to all mail to the recipient
   domain) until the policy expiration.

   An important consideration for domains publishing a policy is that
   senders will see a policy expiration as relative to the fetch of a
   policy cached by their recursive resolver.  Consequently, a sender
   MAY treat a policy as valid for up to {expiration time} + {DNS TTL}.
   Publishers SHOULD thus continue to expect senders to apply old
   policies for up to this duration.

3.3.  Policy Authentication

   The security of a domain implementing an SMTP STS policy against an
   active man-in-the-middle depends primarily upon the long-lived
   caching of policies.  However, to allow recipient domains to safely
   serve new policies _prior_ to the expiration of a cached policy, and
   to prevent long-term (either malicious or active) denials of service,
   it is important that senders are able to validate a new policy
   retrieved for a recipient domain.  There are two supported mechanisms
   for policy validation:

   o  Web PKI: In this mechanism, indicated by the "webpki" value of the
      "a" field, the sender fetches a HTTPS resource from the URI
      indicated.  For example, a=webpki:[1] indicates that the sender
      should fetch the resource [2].  In order for the policy to be
      valid, the HTTP response body served at this resource MUST exactly
      match the policy initially loaded via the DNS TXT method, and MUST
      be served from an HTTPS endpoint at the domain matching that of
      the recipient domain.  (As this RFC progress, the authors intend
      to register .well-known/smtp-sts.  See [RFC5785].  See _Future_
      _Work_ for more information.)

   o  DNSSEC: In this mechanism, indicated by the "dnssec" value of the
      "a" field, the sender MUST retrieve the policy via a DNSSEC signed
      response for the _smtp_sts TXT record.

   When fetching a new policy when one is not already known, or when
   fetching a policy for a domain with an expired policy,
   unauthenticated policies MUST be trusted and honored.  When fetching
   a policy and authenticating it, as described in detail in _Policy_



Margolis, et al.       Expires September 19, 2016               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                  SMTP-STS                      March 2016


   _Application_, policies will be authenticated using the mechanism
   specified by the existing cached policy.

   Note, however, as described in detail in _Policy_ _Application_, that
   new policies MUST NOT be considered as valid if they do not validate
   on first application.  That is, a freshly fetched (and unused) policy
   that has not successfully been applied MUST be disregarded.

3.4.  Policy Validation

   When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid
   and non-expired SMTP STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP STS
   SHOULD validate that the recipient MX supports STARTTLS and offers a
   TLS certificate which is valid according to the semantics of the SMTP
   STS policy.  Policies can specify certificate validity in one of two
   ways by setting the value of the "c" field in the policy description.

   o  Web PKI: When the "c" field is set to "webpki", the certificate
      presented by the receiving MX MUST be valid for the MX name and
      chain to a root CA that is trusted by the sending MTA.  The
      certificate MUST have a CN or SAN matching the MX hostname (as
      described in [RFC6125]) and be non-expired.

   o  DANE TLSA: When the "c" field is set to "tlsa", the receiving MX
      MUST be covered by a DANE TLSA record for the recipient domain,
      and the presented certificate MUST be valid according to that
      record (as described by [RFC7672]).

   A sending MTA who does not support the validation method required--
   for example, an MTA that does not have a DNSSEC-compatible resolver--
   MUST behave as though the policy did not validate.  As described in
   the section on _Policy_ _Application_, a policy which has not ever
   been successfully validated MUST not be used to reject mail.

3.5.  Policy Application

   When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid
   non-expired SMTP STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP STS MAY
   apply the result of a policy validation one of two ways:

   o  Report-only: In this mode, sending MTAs merely send a report to
      the designated report address indicating policy application
      failures.  This can be done "offline", i.e. based on the MTA logs,
      and is thus a suitable low-risk option for MTAs who wish to
      enhance transparency of TLS tampering without making complicated
      changes to production mail-handling infrastructure.

   o  Enforced: In this mode, sending MTAs SHOULD treat STS policy
      failures, in which the policy action is "reject", as a mail
      delivery error, and SHOULD terminate the SMTP connection, not
      delivering any more mail to the recipient MTA.

   In enforced mode, however, sending MTAs MUST first check for a new
   _authenticated_ policy before actually treating a message failure as
   fatal.

   Thus the control flow for a sending MTA that does online policy
   application consists of the following steps:

   1.  Check for cached non-expired policy.  If none exists, fetch the
       latest and cache it.

   2.  Validate recipient MTA against policy.  If valid, deliver mail.

   3.  If policy invalid and policy specifies reporting, generate
       report.

   4.  If policy invalid and policy specifies rejection, perform the
       following steps:

       *  Check for a new (non-cached) _authenticated_ policy.  If one
          exists, update the current policy and go to step 1.

       *  If none exists or the newly fetched policy also fails, treat
          the delivery as a failure.

   Understanding the details of step 4 is critical to understanding the
   behavior of the system as a whole.

   Remember that each policy has an expiration time (which SHOULD be
   long, on the order of days or months) and a validation method.  With
   these two mechanisms and the procedure specified in step 4,
   recipients who publish a policy have, in effect, a means of updating
   a cached policy at arbitrary intervals, without the risks (of a man-
   in-the-middle attack) they would incur if they were to shorten the
   policy expiration time.

4.  Failure Reporting

   Aggregate statistics on policy failures MAY be reported to the URI
   indicated in the "rua" field of the policy.  SMTP STS reports contain
   information about policy failures to allow diagnosis of
   misconfigurations and malicious activity.

   (There may also be a need for enabling more detailed "forensic"
   reporting during initial stages of a deployment.  To address this,
   the authors consider the possibility of an optional additional
   "forensic reporting mode" in which more details--such as certificate
   chains and MTA banners--may be reported.  See the section _Future_
   _Work_ for more details.)

   Aggregate reports contain the following fields:

   o  The SMTP STS policy applied (as a string)

   o  The beginning and end of the reporting period

   Repeated records contain the following fields:

   o  Failure type: This list will start with the minimal set below, and
      is expected to grow over time based on real-world experience.  The
      initial set is:

      *  mx-mismatch: This indicates that the MX resolved for the
         recipient domain did not match the MX constraint specified in
         the policy.

      *  certificate-mismatch: This indicates that the certificate
         presented by the receiving MX did not match the MX hostname

      *  invalid-certificate: This indicates that the certificate
         presented by the receiving MX did not validate according to the
         policy validation constraint.  (Either it was not signed by a
         trusted CA or did not match the DANE TLSA record for the
         recipient MX.)

      *  expired-certificate: This indicates that the certificate has
         expired.

      *  starttls-not-supported: This indicates that the recipient MX
         did not support STARTTLS.

      *  tlsa-invalid: This indicates a validation error for Policy
         Domain specifying "tlsa" validation.

      *  dnssec-invalid: This indicates a failure to validate DNS
         records for a Policy Domain specifying "tlsa" validation or
         "dnssec" authentication.

      *  sender-does-not-support-validation-method: This indicates the
         sending system can never validate using the requested
         validation mechanism.

   o  Count: The number of times the error was encountered.

   o  Hostname: The hostname of the recipient MX.

   Note that the failure types are non-exclusive; an aggregate report
   MAY contain overlapping counts of failure types where a single send
   attempt encountered multiple errors.

   When sending failure reports, sending MTAs MUST NOT honor SMTP STS or
   DANE TLSA failures.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The ".well-known" URI for Policy Domains to host their STS Policies
   will be registered by following the procedure documented in [RFC5785]
   (i.e. sending a request to the "wellknown-uri-review@ietf.org"
   mailing list for review and comment).  The proposed URI-suffix is
   "smtp-sts".

6.  Security Considerations

   SMTP Strict Transport Security protects against an active attacker
   who wishes to intercept or tamper with mail between hosts who support
   STARTTLS.  There are two classes of attacks considered:

   o  Foiling TLS negotiation, for example by deleting the "250
      STARTTLS" response from a server or altering TLS session
      negotiation.  This would result in the SMTP session occurring over
      plaintext, despite both parties supporting TLS.

   o  Impersonating the destination mail server, whereby the sender
      might deliver the message to an impostor, who could then monitor
      and/or modify messages despite opportunistic TLS.  This
      impersonation could be accomplished by spoofing the DNS MX record
      for the recipient domain, or by redirecting client connections to
      the legitimate recipient server (for example, by altering BGP
      routing tables).

   SMTP Strict Transport Security relies on certificate validation via
   either TLS identity checking [RFC6125] or DANE TLSA [RFC7672].
   Attackers who are able to obtain a valid certificate for the targeted
   recipient mail service (e.g. by compromising a certificate authority)
   are thus out of scope of this threat model.

   In the WebPKI constraint mode, an attacker who is able to block DNS
   responses can suppress the delivery of an STS Policy, making the
   Policy Domain appear not to have an STS Policy.  The caching model
   described in _Policy_ _Expirations_ is designed to resist this

   attack, and there is discussion in the _Future_ _Work_ section around
   future distribution mechanisms that are robust against this attack.

7.  Future Work

   The authors would like to suggest multiple considerations for future
   discussion.

   o  Certificate pinning: One potential improvement in the robustness
      of the certificate validation methods discussed would be the
      deployment of public-key pinning as defined for HTTP in [RFC7469].
      A policy extension supporting these semantics would enable Policy
      Domains to specify certificates that MUST appear in the MX
      certificate chain, thus providing resistence against compromised
      CA or DNSSEC zone keys.

   o  Policy distribution: As with Certificate Transparency ([RFC6962]),
      it may be possible to provide a verifiable log of policy
      _observations_ (meaning which policies have been observed for a
      given Policy Domain).  This would provide insight into policy
      spoofing or faked policy non-existence.  This may be particularly
      useful for Policy Domains not using DNSSEC, since it would provide
      sending MTAs an authoritative source for whether a policy is
      expected for a given domain.

   o  Receive-from restrictions: Policy publishers may wish to also
      indicate to domains _receiving_ mail from the Policy Domain that
      all such mail is expected to be sent via TLS.  This may allow
      policy publishers to receive reports indicating sending MTA
      misconfigurations.  However, the security properties of a
      "receiver-enforced" system differ from those of the current
      design; in particular, an active man-in-the-middle attacker may be
      able to exploit misconfigured sending MTAs in a way that would not
      be possible today with a sender-enforced model.

   o  Cipher and TLS version restrictions: Policy publishers may also
      wish to restrict TLS negotiation to specific ciphers or TLS
      versions.

   In addition, the authors leave currently open the following details:

   o  Whether and how more detailed "forensic reporting" should be
      accomplished, as discussed in the section _Failure_ _Reporting_.

   o  The registration of the .well-known/smtp-sts URI as per [RFC5785].

8.  Appendix 1: Validation Pseudocode

      policy = policy_from_cache()
      if not policy or is_expired(policy):
        policy = policy_from_dns()  // fetch and authenticate!
        update_cache = true
      if policy:
        if invalid_mx_or_tls(policy):  // check MX and TLS cert
          if rua:
            generate_report()
          if p_reject():
            policy = policy_from_dns()  // fetch and authenticate #2!
            update_cache = true
            if invalid_mx_or_tls(policy):

              update_cache = false
        if update_cache:

9.  Appendix 2: Domain Owner STS example record


    The owner wishes to begin using STS
    with a policy that will solicit aggregate feedback from receivers
    without affecting how the messages are processed, in order to:

    * Confirm that its legitimate messages are sent over TLS

    * Verify the validity of the certificates

    * Verify what cyphers are in use

    * Determine how many messages would be affected by a strict policy
