.# Abstract

SMTP STS is a mechanism enabling mail service providers to declare their ability
to receive TLS-secured connections, to declare particular methods for
certificate validation, and to request sending SMTP servers to report upon
and/or refuse to deliver messages that cannot be delivered securely.

{mainmatter}

# Introduction

The STARTTLS extension to SMTP [@!RFC3207] allows SMTP clients and hosts to
establish secure SMTP sessions over TLS. In its current form, however, it fails
to provide (a) message confidentiality — because opportunistic STARTTLS is
subject to downgrade attacks — and (b) server authenticity — because the trust
relationship from email domain to MTA server identity is not cryptographically
validated.

While such "opportunistic" encryption protocols provide a high barrier against
passive man-in-the-middle traffic interception, any attacker who can delete
parts of the SMTP session (such as the "250 STARTTLS" response) or who can
redirect the entire SMTP session (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record
of the delivery domain) can perform such a downgrade or interception attack.

This document defines a mechanism for recipient domains to publish policies
specifying:

   * whether MTAs sending mail to this domain can expect TLS support
   * how MTAs can validate the TLS server certificate presented during mail
     delivery
   * the expected identity of MXs that handle mail for this domain
   * what an implementing sender should do with messages when TLS cannot be be
     successfully negotiated

The mechanism described is separated into four logical components:

   1. policy semantics: whether senders can expect a server for the
      recipient domain to support TLS encryption and how to validate the TLS
      certificate presented
   2. policy authentication: how to determine the authenticity of a published
      policy delivered via DNS
   3. failure report format: a mechanism for informing recipient domains about
      aggregate failure statistics
   4. failure handling: what sending MTAs should do in the case of policy
      failures

## Terminology

The keywords **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**,
**SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL**, when
they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in [@!RFC2119].

We also define the following terms for further use in this document:

* STS Policy: A definition of the expected TLS availability and behavior, as
  well as the desired actions for a given domain when a sending MTA encounters
  different results.
* Policy Domain: The domain against which an STS Policy is defined.

# Related Technologies

The DANE TLSA record [@!RFC7672] is similar, in that DANE is also designed to
upgrade opportunistic encryption into required encryption. DANE requires DNSSEC
[@!RFC4033] for the secure delivery of policies; the mechanism described here
presents a variant for systems not yet supporting DNSSEC, and specifies a method
for reporting TLS negotiation failures.

## Differences from DANE

The primary difference between the mechanism described here and DANE is that DANE
requires the use of DNSSEC to authenticate DANE TLSA records, whereas SMTP STS
relies on the certificate authority (CA) system and a trust-on-first-use (TOFU)
approach to avoid interception. The TOFU model allows a degree of security
similar to that of HPKP [@!RFC7469], reducing the complexity but without the
guarantees on first use offered by DNSSEC. (For a thorough discussion of this
trade-off, see the section _Security_ _Considerations_.)

In addition, SMTP STS introduces a mechanism for failure reporting and a
report-only mode, enabling offline ("report-only") deployments and auditing for
compliance.

## Advantages When Used with DANE

SMTP STS can be deployed for a recipient domain that also publishes a DANE TLSA
record for SMTP. In these cases, the SMTP STS policy can additionally declare a
process for failure reporting.

## Advantages When Used Without DANE

When deployed without a DANE TLSA record, SMTP STS offers the following
advantages compared to DANE:

   * *Infrastructure:* In comparison to DANE, this proposal does not require
     DNSSEC be deployed on either the sending or receiving domain. In addition,
     the reporting feature of SMTP STS can be deployed to perform offline
     analysis of STARTTLS failures, enabling mail providers to gain insight into
     the security of their SMTP connections without the need to modify MTA
     codebases directly.
   * *Offline- or report-only usage:* DANE does not provide a reporting
     mechanism and does not have a concept of "report-only" for failures; as a
     result, a service provider cannot receive metrics on TLS acceptability
     without asking senders to enforce a given policy; similarly, senders who
     cannot enforce DANE constraints at send-time have no mechanism to provide
     recipients such metrics from an offline (and potentially easier-to-deploy)
     logs-analysis batch process.

## Disadvantages When Used Without DANE

When deployed alone (i.e. without a DANE record, and using Web PKI for
certificate verification), SMTP STS offers the following disadvantages compared
to DANE:

* Infrastructure: DANE may be easier for some providers to deploy. In
  particular, for providers who already support DNSSEC, SMTP STS would
  additionally require they obtain a CA-signed x509 certificate for the
  recipient domain.

* Security: DANE offers an advantage against policy-lookup DoS attacks; that is,
  while a DNSSEC-signed NXDOMAIN response to a DANE lookup authoritatively
  indicates the lack of a DANE record, such an option to authenticate policy
  non-existence does not exist when looking up a policy over plain DNS.

# Policy Semantics

SMTP STS policies are distributed via DNS from the Policy Domain's zone either
through a new resource record, or as TXT records (similar to DMARC policies)
under the name "_smtp_sts". (Current implementations deploy as TXT records.) For
example, for the Policy Domain "example.com", the recipient's SMTP STS policy
can be retrieved from "_smtp_sts.example.com."

(Future implementations may move to alternate methods of policy discovery or
distribution. See the section _Future_ _Work_ for more discussion.)

Policies MUST specify the following fields:

* v: Version (plain-text, required). Currently only "STS1" is supported.
* m: Mode (plain-text, required). If "enforce", the receiving MTA requests that
  messages be delivered only if they conform to the STS policy. If "report" the
  receiving MTA requests that failure reports be delivered, as specified by the
  `rua` parameter.
* mx: MX patterns (comma-separated list of plain-text MX match patterns,
  required). One or more comma-separated patterns matching the expected MX for
  this domain. For example, "*.example.com,*.example.net" indicates that mail
  for this domain might be handled by any MX whose hostname is a subdomain of
  "example.com" or "example.net."
* a: The mechanism to use to authenticate this policy itself. See the section
  _Policy_ _Discovery_ _&_ _Authentication_ for more details. Possible values
  are:
  * webpki:URI, where URI points to an HTTPS resource at the recipient domain
    that serves the same policy text.
  * dnssec: Indicating that the policy is expected to be served over DNSSEC.
* c: Constraints on the recipient MX's TLS certificate (plain-text, required).
  See the section _Policy_ _Validation_ for more details. Possible values are:
  * webpki: Indicating that the TLS certificate presented by the recipient MX
    will be validated according to the "web PKI" mechanism.
  * tlsa: Indicating that the TLS certificate presented by the recipient MX
    will match a (presumed to exist) DANE TLSA record.
* e: Max lifetime of the policy (plain-text integer seconds). Well-behaved
  clients SHOULD cache a policy for up to this value from last policy fetch
  time.
* rua: [@!RFC3986] URI(s) to which aggregate feedback MAY be sent
  (comma-separated plain-text list of email addresses or HTTPS endpoints,
  optional). For example, "mailto:postmaster@example.com" or
  `https://example.com/sts-report`.

## Formal Definition

The formal definition of the SMTP STS format, using [@!RFC5234], is as follows:

    sts-uri         = URI [ "!" 1*DIGIT [ "k" / "m" / "g" / "t" ] ]
                       ; "URI" is imported from [RFC3986]; commas (ASCII
                       ; 0x2C) and exclamation points (ASCII 0x21)
                       ; MUST be encoded; the numeric portion MUST fit
                       ; within an unsigned 64-bit integer

    sts-record      = sts-version sts-sep sts-to
                       [sts-sep sts-mx]
                       [sts-sep sts-a]
                       [sts-sep sts-c]
                       [sts-sep sts-e]
                       [sts-sep sts-auri]
                       [sts-sep]
                       ; components other than sts-version and
                       ; sts-m may appear in any order

    sts-version     = "v" *WSP "=" *WSP %x53 %x54 %x53 %x31

    sts-sep         = *WSP %x3b *WSP

    sts-m           = "to" *WSP "=" *WSP ( "enforce" / "report" )

    sts-mx          = "mx" *WSP "=" *WSP sts-domain-list

    sts-domain-list = (domain-match *("," domain-match))

    domain-match    =  ["*."] 1*dtext *("." 1*dtext)

    dtext           =  %d30-39 /          ; 0-9
                       %d41-5A /          ; a-z
                       %61-7A /           ; A-Z
                       %2D                ; "-"

    sts-a           = "a" *WSP "=" *WSP ( "webpki" / "dnssec")

    sts-c           = "c" *WSP "=" *WSP ( "webpki" / "tlsa")

    sts-e           = "e" *WSP "=" *WSP 1*10DIGIT

    sts-auri        = "rua" *WSP "=" *WSP
                       sts-uri *(*WSP "," *WSP sts-uri)

A size limitation in a sts-uri, if provided, is interpreted as a
count of units followed by an OPTIONAL unit size ("k" for kilobytes,
"m" for megabytes, "g" for gigabytes, "t" for terabytes).  Without a
unit, the number is presumed to be a basic byte count.  Note that the
units are considered to be powers of two; a kilobyte is 2^10, a
megabyte is 2^20, etc.

## Policy Expirations

In order to resist attackers inserting a fraudulent policy, SMTP STS policies
are designed to be long-lived, with an expiry typically greater than two weeks.
Policy validity is controlled by two separate expiration times: the lifetime
indicated in the policy ("e=") and the TTL on the DNS record itself. The policy
expiration will ordinarily be longer than that of the DNS TTL, and senders
SHOULD cache a policy (and apply it to all mail to the recipient domain) until
the policy expiration.

An important consideration for domains publishing a policy is that senders will
see a policy expiration as relative to the fetch of a policy cached by their
recursive resolver. Consequently, a sender MAY treat a policy as valid for up to
{expiration time} + {DNS TTL}. Publishers SHOULD thus continue to expect senders
to apply old policies for up to this duration.

### Policy Updates

For policies authenticated via "webpki", updating the policy requires that the
owner make changes in two places: the _smtp_sts RR record in the Policy Domain's
DNS zone and at the corresponding HTTPS endpoint. In the case of a
race-condition if the policy update in HTTPS lags behind the DNS TXT record or
vice versa, the policy fetched during that period will fail to authenticate (and
is thus treated as though it did not exist, as described in _Policy_
_Authentication_).  Senders who have a cached policy will thus fall back to that
cached policy. Thus Policy Domains can expect an existing published policy to be
used until an update is rolled out in both locations.

## Policy Discovery & Authentication

Senders discover a recipient domain's STS policy by making an attempt to fetch
TXT records from the recipient domain's DNS zone with the name "_smtp_sts". If
found, the policy is fetched and authenticated. The security of a domain
implementing an SMTP STS policy against an active man-in-the-middle depends
primarily upon the long-lived caching of policies.  However, to allow recipient
domains to safely serve new policies _prior_ to the expiration of a cached
policy, and to prevent long-term denials of service, it is important that
senders are able to authenticate a new policy retrieved for a recipient domain.
There are two supported mechanisms for policy authentication:

* Web PKI: In this mechanism, indicated by the "webpki" value of the "a" field,
  the sender fetches a HTTPS resource from a host at `policy._smtp_sts` in the
  Policy Domain. For example, a=webpki indicates that the sender should fetch
  the resource from https://policy._smtp_sts.example.com/current. In order for
  the policy to be valid, the HTTP response body served at this resource MUST
  exactly match the policy initially loaded via the DNS TXT method, and MUST be
  served from an HTTPS endpoint at the domain matching that of the recipient
  domain. Since the policy is served from a special subdomain, MTA operators may
  host a separate web server different from on their main domain. This model
  also enables a third party mail service provider to host a policy for their
  users' domains.

* DNSSEC: In this mechanism, indicated by the "dnssec" value of the "a" field,
  the sender MUST retrieve the policy via a DNSSEC signed response for the
  _smtp_sts TXT record.

When fetching a new policy or updated policy,the new policy MUST be
authenticated before use.

## Policy Validation

When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid and
non-expired SMTP STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP STS SHOULD validate
that the recipient MX supports STARTTLS and offers a TLS certificate which is
valid according to the semantics of the SMTP STS policy. Policies can specify
certificate validity in one of two ways by setting the value of the "c" field in
the policy description.

* Web PKI: When the "c" field is set to "webpki", the certificate presented by
  the receiving MX MUST be valid for the MX name and chain to a root CA that is
  trusted by the sending MTA. The certificate MUST have a CN or SAN matching the
  MX hostname (as described in [@!RFC6125]) and be non-expired.

* DANE TLSA: When the "c" field is set to "tlsa", the receiving MX MUST be
  covered by a DANE TLSA record for the recipient domain, and the presented
  certificate MUST be valid according to that record (as described by
  [@!RFC7672]).

A sending MTA who does not support the validation method required--for example,
an MTA that does not have a DNSSEC-compatible resolver--MUST behave as though
the policy did not validate. As described in the section on _Policy_
_Application_, a policy which has not ever been successfully validated MUST not
be used to reject mail.

## Policy Application

When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid non-expired
SMTP STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP STS MAY apply the result of a
policy validation one of two ways:

* Report-only: In this mode, sending MTAs merely send a report to the designated
  report address indicating policy application failures. This can be done
  "offline", i.e. based on the MTA logs, and is thus a suitable low-risk option
  for MTAs who wish to enhance transparency of TLS tampering without making
  complicated changes to production mail-handling infrastructure.

* Enforced: In this mode, sending MTAs SHOULD treat STS policy failures, in
  which the policy action is "reject", as a mail delivery error, and SHOULD
  terminate the SMTP connection, not delivering any more mail to the recipient
  MTA.

In enforced mode, however, sending MTAs MUST first check for a new
_authenticated_ policy before actually treating a message failure as fatal.

Thus the control flow for a sending MTA that does online policy application
consists of the following steps:

1. Check for cached non-expired policy. If none exists, fetch the latest,
   authenticate and cache it.
2. Validate recipient MTA against policy. If valid, deliver mail.
3. If policy invalid and policy specifies reporting, generate report.
4. If policy invalid and policy specifies rejection, perform the following
   steps:

  * Check for a new (non-cached) _authenticated_ policy. If one exists, update
    the current policy and go to step 1.
  * If none exists or the newly fetched policy also fails, treat the delivery
    as a failure.

Understanding the details of step 4 is critical to understanding the behavior of
the system as a whole.

Remember that each policy has an expiration time (which SHOULD be long, on the
order of days or months) and a validation method. With these two mechanisms and
the procedure specified in step 4, recipients who publish a policy have, in
effect, a means of updating a cached policy at arbitrary intervals, without the
risks (of a man-in-the-middle attack) they would incur if they were to shorten
the policy expiration time.

# Failure Reporting

Aggregate statistics on policy failures MAY be reported to the URI indicated
in the "rua" field of the policy. SMTP STS reports contain information about
policy failures to allow diagnosis of misconfigurations and malicious activity.

(There may also be a need for enabling more detailed "forensic" reporting during
initial stages of a deployment. To address this, the authors consider the
possibility of an optional additional "forensic reporting mode" in which more
details--such as certificate chains and MTA banners--may be reported. See the
section _Future_ _Work_ for more details.)

Likely URI schemes include "mailto" and "https". In the case of "https", reports
should be submitted via POST  ([@!RFC2818]) to the specified URI.

Aggregate reports contain the following fields:

* The SMTP STS policy applied (as a string)
* The beginning and end of the reporting period

Repeated records contain the following fields:

* Failure type: This list will start with the minimal set below, and is expected
  to grow over time based on real-world experience. The initial set is:

  * mx-mismatch: This indicates that the MX resolved for the recipient domain did
    not match the MX constraint specified in the policy.
  * certificate-mismatch: This indicates that the certificate presented by the
    receiving MX did not match the MX hostname
  * invalid-certificate: This indicates that the certificate presented by the
    receiving MX did not validate according to the policy validation constraint.
    (Either it was not signed by a trusted CA or did not match the DANE TLSA
    record for the recipient MX.)
  * expired-certificate: This indicates that the certificate has expired.
  * starttls-not-supported: This indicates that the recipient MX did not support
    STARTTLS.
  * tlsa-invalid: This indicates a validation error for Policy Domain specifying
    "tlsa" validation.
  * dnssec-invalid: This indicates a failure to validate DNS records for a
    Policy Domain specifying "tlsa" validation or "dnssec" authentication.
  * sender-does-not-support-validation-method: This indicates the sending system
    can never validate using the requested validation mechanism.

* Count: The number of times the error was encountered.
* Hostname: The hostname of the recipient MX.

Note that the failure types are non-exclusive; an aggregate report MAY contain
overlapping counts of failure types where a single send attempt encountered
multiple errors.

When sending failure reports via SMTP, sending MTAs MUST NOT honor SMTP STS or
DANE TLSA failures.

# IANA Considerations

There are no IANA considerations at this time.

# Security Considerations

SMTP Strict Transport Security protects against an active attacker who wishes to
intercept or tamper with mail between hosts who support STARTTLS. There are two
classes of attacks considered:

* Foiling TLS negotiation, for example by deleting the "250 STARTTLS" response
  from a server or altering TLS session negotiation. This would result in the
  SMTP session occurring over plaintext, despite both parties supporting TLS.

* Impersonating the destination mail server, whereby the sender might deliver
  the message to an impostor, who could then monitor and/or modify messages
  despite opportunistic TLS. This impersonation could be accomplished by
  spoofing the DNS MX record for the recipient domain, or by redirecting client
  connections to the legitimate recipient server (for example, by altering BGP
  routing tables).

SMTP Strict Transport Security relies on certificate validation via either TLS
identity checking [@!RFC6125] or DANE TLSA [@!RFC7672]. Attackers who are able
to obtain a valid certificate for the targeted recipient mail service (e.g. by
compromising a certificate authority) are thus out of scope of this threat
model.

In the WebPKI constraint mode, an attacker who is able to block DNS responses can
suppress the delivery of an STS Policy, making the Policy Domain appear not to have
an STS Policy. The caching model described in _Policy_ _Expirations_ is designed to
resist this attack, and there is discussion in the _Future_ _Work_ section around
future distribution mechanisms that are robust against this attack.

# Future Work

The authors would like to suggest multiple considerations for future discussion.

* Certificate pinning: One potential improvement in the robustness of the
  certificate validation methods discussed would be the deployment of public-key
  pinning as defined for HTTP in [@!RFC7469]. A policy extension supporting
  these semantics would enable Policy Domains to specify certificates that MUST
  appear in the MX certificate chain, thus providing resistence against
  compromised CA or DNSSEC zone keys.

* Policy distribution: As with Certificate Transparency ([@!RFC6962]), it may be
  possible to provide a verifiable log of policy *observations* (meaning which
  policies have been observed for a given Policy Domain). This would provide
  insight into policy spoofing or faked policy non-existence. This may be
  particularly useful for Policy Domains not using DNSSEC, since it would
  provide sending MTAs an authoritative source for whether a policy is expected
  for a given domain.

* Receive-from restrictions: Policy publishers may wish to also indicate to
  domains *receiving* mail from the Policy Domain that all such mail is expected
  to be sent via TLS. This may allow policy publishers to receive reports
  indicating sending MTA misconfigurations. However, the security properties of
  a "receiver-enforced" system differ from those of the current design; in
  particular, an active man-in-the-middle attacker may be able to exploit
  misconfigured sending MTAs in a way that would not be possible today with a
  sender-enforced model.

* Cipher and TLS version restrictions: Policy publishers may also wish to
  restrict TLS negotiation to specific ciphers or TLS versions.

In addition, the authors leave currently open the following details:

* Whether and how more detailed "forensic reporting" should be accomplished, as
  discussed in the section _Failure_ _Reporting_.

# Appendix 2: Domain Owner STS example record

## Example 1

The owner of example.com wishes to begin using STS with a policy that will
solicit aggregate feedback from receivers without affecting how the messages
are processed, in order to:

* Confirm that its legitimate messages are sent over TLS

* Verify the validity of the certificates

* Verify what ciphers are in use

* Determine how many messages would be affected by a strict policy

~~~~~~~~~
_smtp_sts  IN TXT ( "v=STS1; m=report; "
                     "mx=*mail.example.com; "
                     "a=dnssec; c=webpki; e=123456"
                     "rua=mailto:sts-feedback@example.com" )
~~~~~~~~~

## Example 2

Similar to Example 1 above, but in _enforce_ mode. Since the auth field 'a' is
webpki, the sender will authenticate the policy by making a HTTPS request to:
https://policy._smtp_sts.example.com/current and compare the content with the
policy in the DNS. example.com is the recipient's domain.

~~~~~~~~~
_smtp_sts  IN TXT ( "v=STS1; m=enforce; "
                     "mx=*mail.example.com; "
                     "a=webpki; c=webpki; e=123456"
