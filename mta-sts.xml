<abstract>
<t>SMTP Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) is a mechanism
enabling mail service providers to declare their ability to receive Transport
Layer Security (TLS) secure SMTP connections, and to specify whether sending
SMTP servers should refuse to deliver to MX hosts that do not offer TLS with a
trusted server certificate.
</t>
</abstract>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>The STARTTLS extension to SMTP <xref target="RFC3207"/> allows SMTP clients and hosts to
negotiate the use of a TLS channel for encrypted mail transmission.
</t>
<t>While this opportunistic encryption protocol by itself provides a high barrier
against passive man-in-the-middle traffic interception, any attacker who can
delete parts of the SMTP session (such as the &quot;250 STARTTLS&quot; response) or who
can redirect the entire SMTP session (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX
record of the delivery domain) can perform downgrade or interception attacks.
</t>
<t>This document defines a mechanism for recipient domains to publish policies, via
a combination of DNS and HTTPS, specifying:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>whether MTAs sending mail to this domain can expect PKIX-authenticated TLS
 support</t>
<t>what a conforming client should do with messages when TLS cannot be
 successfully negotiated</t>
</list>
</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
<t>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;,
&quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14] <xref target="RFC2119"/>
<xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
</t>
<t>We also define the following terms for further use in this document:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>MTA-STS Policy: A commitment by the Policy Domain to support PKIX <xref target="RFC5280"/>
authenticated TLS for the specified MX hosts.</t>
<t>Policy Domain: The domain for which an MTA-STS Policy is defined.  This is the
next-hop domain; when sending mail to &quot;alice@example.com&quot; this would
ordinarily be &quot;example.com&quot;, but this may be overridden by explicit routing
rules (as described in <xref target="policy-selection-for-smart-hosts-and-subdomains"/>,
&quot;Policy Selection for Smart Hosts and Subdomains&quot;).</t>
<t>Policy Host: The HTTPS host which serves the MTA-STS Policy for a Policy
Domain. Rules for constructing the hostname are described in
<xref target="mtasts-policies"/>, &quot;MTA-STS Policies&quot;.</t>
<t>Sender: The SMTP Mail Transfer Agent sending an email message.</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="related-technologies" title="Related Technologies">
<t>The DANE TLSA record <xref target="RFC7672"/> is similar, in that DANE is also designed to
upgrade unauthenticated encryption or plaintext transmission into authenticated,
downgrade-resistant encrypted transmission.  DANE requires DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4033"/>
for authentication; the mechanism described here instead relies on certificate
authorities (CAs) and does not require DNSSEC, at a cost of risking malicious
downgrades.  For a thorough discussion of this trade-off, see
<xref target="security-considerations"/>, &quot;Security Considerations&quot;.
</t>
<t>In addition, MTA-STS provides an optional testing-only mode, enabling soft
deployments to detect policy failures; partial deployments can be achieved in
DANE by deploying TLSA records only for some of a domain's MXs, but such a
mechanism is not possible for the per-domain policies used by MTA-STS.
</t>
<t>The primary motivation of MTA-STS is to provide a mechanism for domains to
ensure transport security even when deploying DNSSEC is undesirable or
impractical.  However, MTA-STS is designed not to interfere with DANE
deployments when the two overlap; in particular, senders who implement MTA-STS
validation MUST NOT allow a &quot;valid&quot; or &quot;testing&quot;-only MTA-STS validation to
override a failing DANE validation.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="policy-discovery" title="Policy Discovery">
<t>MTA-STS policies are distributed via HTTPS from a &quot;well-known&quot; <xref target="RFC5785"/> path
served within the Policy Domain, and their presence and current version are
indicated by a TXT record at the Policy Domain.  These TXT records additionally
contain a policy <spanx style="verb">id</spanx> field, allowing sending MTAs to check the currency of a
cached policy without performing an HTTPS request.
</t>
<t>To discover if a recipient domain implements MTA-STS, a sender need only resolve
a single TXT record.  To see if an updated policy is available for a domain for
which the sender has a previously cached policy, the sender need only check the
TXT record's version <spanx style="verb">id</spanx> against the cached value.
</t>

<section anchor="mtasts-txt-records" title="MTA-STS TXT Records">
<t>The MTA-STS TXT record is a TXT record with the name <spanx style="verb">_mta-sts</spanx> at the Policy
Domain.  For the domain <spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx>, this record would be
<spanx style="verb">_mta-sts.example.com</spanx>.  MTA-STS TXT records MUST be US-ASCII,
semicolon-separated key/value pairs containing the following fields:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t><spanx style="verb">v</spanx>: (plain-text, required).  Currently only &quot;STSv1&quot; is supported.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">id</spanx>: (plain-text, required).  A short string used to track policy updates.
This string MUST uniquely identify a given instance of a policy, such that
senders can determine when the policy has been updated by comparing to the
<spanx style="verb">id</spanx> of a previously seen policy.  There is no implied ordering of <spanx style="verb">id</spanx> fields
between revisions.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>An example TXT record is as below:
</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">_mta-sts.example.com.  IN TXT "v=STSv1; id=20160831085700Z;"</spanx>
</t>
<t>The formal definition of the <spanx style="verb">_mta-sts</spanx> TXT record, defined using <xref target="RFC7405"/>,
is as follows:
</t>

<figure align="center"><artwork align="center">
sts-text-record = sts-version 1*(field-delim sts-field) [field-delim]

sts-field       = sts-id /                 ; Note that sts-id record
                  sts-extension            ; is required.

field-delim     = *WSP ";" *WSP

sts-version     = %s"v=STSv1"

sts-id          = %s"id=" 1*32(ALPHA / DIGIT)     ; id=...

sts-extension   = sts-ext-name "=" sts-ext-value  ; name=value

sts-ext-name    = (ALPHA / DIGIT)
                  *31(ALPHA / DIGIT / "_" / "-" / ".")

sts-ext-value   = 1*(%x21-3A / %x3C / %x3E-7E)
                  ; chars excluding "=", ";", and control chars
</artwork></figure>
<t>The TXT record MUST begin with sts-version field, and the order of other fields
is not significant.  If multiple TXT records for <spanx style="verb">_mta-sts</spanx> are returned by the
resolver, records which do not begin with <spanx style="verb">v=STSv1;</spanx> are discarded.  If the
number of resulting records is not one, senders MUST assume the recipient domain
does not have an available MTA-STS policy and skip the remaining steps of policy
discovery.  (Note that lack of an available policy does not signal opting out of
MTA-STS altogether if the sender has a previously cached policy for the
recipient domain, as discussed in <xref target="policy-application-control-flow"/>, &quot;Policy
Application Control Flow&quot;.)  If the resulting TXT record contains multiple
strings, then the record MUST be treated as if those strings are concatenated
together without adding spaces.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="mtasts-policies" title="MTA-STS Policies">
<t>The policy itself is a set of key/value pairs (similar to <xref target="RFC5322"/> header
fields) served via the HTTPS GET method from the fixed <xref target="RFC5785"/> &quot;well-known&quot;
path of <spanx style="verb">.well-known/mta-sts.txt</spanx> served by the Policy Host.  The Policy Host
DNS name is constructed by prepending <spanx style="verb">mta-sts</spanx> to the Policy Domain.
</t>
<t>Thus for a Policy Domain of <spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx> the path is
<spanx style="verb">https://mta-sts.example.com/.well-known/mta-sts.txt</spanx>.
</t>
<t>When fetching a policy, senders SHOULD validate that the media type is
&quot;text/plain&quot; to guard against cases where webservers allow untrusted users to
host non-text content (typically, HTML or images) at a user-defined path.  All
parameters other than charset=utf-8 or charset=us-ascii are ignored.  Additional
&quot;Content-Type&quot; parameters are also ignored.
</t>
<t>This resource contains the following CRLF-separated key/value pairs:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t><spanx style="verb">version</spanx>: Currently only &quot;STSv1&quot; is supported.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">mode</spanx>: One of &quot;enforce&quot;, &quot;testing&quot;, or &quot;none&quot;, indicating the expected
behavior of a sending MTA in the case of a policy validation failure.  See
<xref target="policy-application"/>, &quot;Policy Application.&quot; for more details about the three
modes.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">max_age</spanx>: Max lifetime of the policy (plain-text non-negative integer
seconds, maximum value of 31557600).  Well-behaved clients SHOULD cache a
policy for up to this value from last policy fetch time.  To mitigate the
risks of attacks at policy refresh time, it is expected that this value
typically be in the range of weeks or greater.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">mx</spanx>: Allowed MX patterns.  One or more patterns matching allowed MX hosts for
the Policy Domain.  As an example,</t>
</list>
</t>

<figure align="center"><artwork align="center">
 mx: mail.example.com &lt;CRLF&gt;
 mx: *.example.net
</artwork></figure>
<t>indicates that mail for this domain might be handled by MX <spanx style="verb">mail.example.com</spanx>
  or any MX at <spanx style="verb">example.net</spanx>.  Valid patterns can be either fully specified
  names (<spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx>) or suffixes prefixed by a wildcard (<spanx style="verb">*.example.net</spanx>).
  If a policy specifies more than one MX, each MX MUST have its own <spanx style="verb">mx:</spanx> key,
  and each MX key/value pair MUST be on its own line in the policy file.  In the
  case of Internationalized Domain Names (<xref target="RFC5891"/>), the <spanx style="verb">mx</spanx> value MUST
  specify the Punycode-encoded A-label <xref target="RFC3492"/> to match against, and not the
  Unicode-encoded U-label.  The full semantics of certificate validation
  (including the use of wildcard patterns) are described in
  <xref target="mx-host-validation"/>, &quot;MX Host Validation.&quot;

<section anchor="https-policy-fetching" title="HTTPS Policy Fetching">
<t>Policy bodies are, as described above, retrieved by sending MTAs via HTTPS
<xref target="RFC2818"/>.  During the TLS handshake initiated to fetch a new or updated
policy from the Policy Host, the Policy Host HTTPS server MUST present a X.509
certificate which is valid for the <spanx style="verb">mta-sts</spanx> DNS-ID (<xref target="RFC6125"/>) (e.g.,
<spanx style="verb">mta-sts.example.com</spanx>) as described below, chain to a root CA that is trusted by
the sending MTA, and be non-expired.  It is expected that sending MTAs use a set
of trusted CAs similar to those in widely deployed Web browsers and operating
systems.  See <xref target="RFC5280"/> for more details about certificate verification.
</t>
<t>The certificate is valid for the Policy Host (i.e., <spanx style="verb">mta-sts</spanx> prepended to the
Policy Domain) with respect to the rules described in <xref target="RFC6125"/>, with the
following application-specific considerations:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Matching is performed only against the DNS-ID identifiers.</t>
<t>DNS domain names in server certificates MAY contain the wildcard character
'*' as the complete left-most label within the identifier.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>The certificate MAY be checked for revocation via the Online Certificate Status
Protocol (OCSP) <xref target="RFC6960"/>, certificate revocation lists (CRLs), or some other
mechanism.
</t>
<t>Policies fetched via HTTPS are only valid if the HTTP response code is 200 (OK).
HTTP 3xx redirects MUST NOT be followed, and HTTP caching (as specified in
<xref target="RFC7234"/>) MUST NOT be used.
</t>
<t>Senders may wish to rate-limit the frequency of attempts to fetch the HTTPS
endpoint even if a valid TXT record for the recipient domain exists.  In the
case that the HTTPS GET fails, we suggest implementions may limit further
attempts to a period of five minutes or longer per version ID, to avoid
overwhelming resource-constrained recipients with cascading failures.
</t>
<t>Senders MAY impose a timeout on the HTTPS GET and/or a limit on the maximum size
of the response body to avoid long delays or resource exhaustion during
attempted policy updates.  A suggested timeout is one minute, and a suggested
maximum policy size 64 kilobytes; policy hosts SHOULD respond to requests with a
complete policy body within that timeout and size limit.
</t>
<t>If a valid TXT record is found but no policy can be fetched via HTTPS (for any
reason), and there is no valid (non-expired) previously-cached policy, senders
MUST continue with delivery as though the domain has not implemented MTA-STS.
</t>
<t>Conversely, if no &quot;live&quot; policy can be discovered via DNS or fetched via HTTPS,
but a valid (non-expired) policy exists in the sender's cache, the sender MUST
apply that cached policy.
</t>
<t>Finally, to mitigate the risk of persistent interference with policy refresh, as
discussed in-depth in <xref target="security-considerations"/>, MTAs SHOULD proactively
refresh cached policies before they expire; a suggested refresh frequency is
once per day.  To enable administrators to discover problems with policy
refresh, MTAs SHOULD alert administrators (through the use of logs or similar)
when such attempts fail, unless the cached policy mode is <spanx style="verb">none</spanx>.
</t>

<section anchor="policy-selection-for-smart-hosts-and-subdomains" title="Policy Selection for Smart Hosts and Subdomains">
<t>When sending mail via a &quot;smart host&quot;--an administratively configured
intermediate SMTP relay, which is different from the message recipient's server
as determined from DNS --compliant senders MUST treat the smart host domain as
the policy domain for the purposes of policy discovery and application.
</t>
<t>When sending mail to a mailbox at a subdomain, compliant senders MUST NOT
attempt to fetch a policy from the parent zone.  Thus for mail sent to
&quot;user@mail.example.com&quot;, the policy can be fetched only from &quot;mail.example.com&quot;,
not &quot;example.com&quot;.

<section anchor="policy-validation" title="Policy Validation">
<t>When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid and
non-expired MTA-STS policy, a sending MTA honoring MTA-STS MUST validate:

as described in <xref target="mx-host-validation"/>, &quot;MX Host Validation&quot;.</t>

certificate, during TLS handshake, which is valid for that host, as described
in <xref target="recipient-mta-certificate-validation"/>, &quot;Recipient MTA Certificate

</t>
<t>This section does not dictate the behavior of sending MTAs when policies fail to

implementing domains to update long-lived policies on the fly.

<section anchor="sni-support" title="SNI Support">
<t>To ensure that the server sends the right certificate chain, the SMTP client
MUST have support for the TLS SNI extension <xref target="RFC6066"/>.  When connecting to a
HTTP server to retrieve the MTA-STS policy, the SNI extension MUST contain the
name of the policy host (e.g., <spanx style="verb">mta-sts.example.com</spanx>).  When connecting to an
SMTP server, the SNI extension MUST contain the MX hostname.
</t>
<t>HTTP servers used to deliver MTA-STS policies MAY rely on SNI to determine which
certificate chain to present to the client.  HTTP servers MUST respond with a
certificate chain that matches the policy hostname or abort the TLS handshake if
unable to do so.  Clients that do not send SNI information may not see the
expected certificate chain.
</t>
<t>SMTP servers MAY rely on SNI to determine which certificate chain to present to
the client.  However servers that have one identity and a single matching
certificate do not require SNI support.  Servers MUST NOT enforce the use of SNI
by clients, as the client may be using unauthenticated opportunistic TLS and may
not expect any particular certificate from the server.  If the client sends no
SNI extension or sends an SNI extension for an unsupported server name, the
server MUST simply send a fallback certificate chain of its choice.  The reason
for not enforcing strict matching of the requested SNI hostname is that MTA-STS
TLS clients may be typically willing to accept multiple server names but can
only send one name in the SNI extension.  The server's fallback certificate may
match a different name that is acceptable to the client, e.g., the original
next-hop domain.

<section anchor="operational-considerations" title="Operational Considerations">

<section anchor="policy-updates" title="Policy Updates">
<t>Updating the policy requires that the owner make changes in two places: the
<spanx style="verb">_mta-sts</spanx> TXT record in the Policy Domain's DNS zone and at the corresponding
HTTPS endpoint.  As a result, recipients should expect a policy will continue to
be used by senders until both the HTTPS and TXT endpoints are updated and the
TXT record's TTL has passed.
</t>
<t>In other words, a sender who is unable to successfully deliver a message while
applying a cache of the recipient's now-outdated policy may be unable to
discover that a new policy exists until the DNS TTL has passed.  Recipients
should therefore ensure that old policies continue to work for message delivery
during this period of time, or risk message delays.
</t>
<t>Recipients should also prefer to update the HTTPS policy body before updating
the TXT record; this ordering avoids the risk that senders, seeing a new TXT
record, mistakenly cache the old policy from HTTPS.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="policy-delegation" title="Policy Delegation">
<t>Domain owners commonly delegate SMTP hosting to a different organization, such
as an ISP or a Web host.  In such a case, they may wish to also delegate the
MTA-STS policy to the same organization which can be accomplished with two
changes.
</t>
<t>First, the Policy Domain must point the <spanx style="verb">_mta-sts</spanx> record, via CNAME, to the
<spanx style="verb">_mta-sts</spanx> record maintained by the hosting organization.  This allows the
hosting organization to control update signaling.
</t>
<t>Second, the Policy Domain must point the &quot;well-known&quot; policy location to the
hosting organization.  This can be done either by setting the <spanx style="verb">mta-sts</spanx> record
to an IP address or CNAME specified by the hosting organization and by giving
the hosting organization a TLS certificate which is valid for that host, or by
setting up a &quot;reverse proxy&quot; (also known as a &quot;gateway&quot;) server that serves as
the Policy Domain's policy the policy currently served by the hosting
organization.
</t>
<t>For example, given a user domain <spanx style="verb">user.example</spanx> hosted by a mail provider
<spanx style="verb">provider.example</spanx>, the following configuration would allow policy delegation:
</t>
<t>DNS:
</t>

<figure align="center"><artwork align="center">
_mta-sts.user.example.  IN CNAME _mta-sts.provider.example.
</artwork></figure>
<t>Policy:
</t>

<figure align="center"><artwork align="center">
&gt; GET /.well-known/mta-sts.txt Host: mta-sts.user.example
&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK  # Response proxies content from
                   # https://mta-sts.provider.example
</artwork></figure>
<t>Note that in all such cases, the policy endpoint
(<spanx style="verb">https://mta-sts.user.example/.well-known/mta-sts.txt</spanx> in this example) must
still present a certificate valid for the Policy Domain (<spanx style="verb">user.example</spanx>), and
not for that of the provider (<spanx style="verb">provider.example</spanx>).
</t>
<t>Note that while sending MTAs MUST NOT use HTTP caching when fetching policies
via HTTPS, such caching may nonetheless be useful to a reverse proxy configured
as described in this section.  An HTTPS policy endpoint expecting to be proxied
for multiple hosted domains--as with a large mail hosting provider or
similar--may wish to indicate an HTTP Cache-Control <spanx style="verb">max-age</spanx> response directive
(as specified in <xref target="RFC7234"/>) of 60 seconds as a reasonable value to save
reverse proxies an unnecessarily high-rate of proxied policy fetching.
</t>

<section anchor="removing-mtasts" title="Removing MTA-STS">
<t>In order to facilitate clean opt-out of MTA-STS by implementing policy domains,
and to distinguish clearly between failures which indicate attacks and those
which indicate such opt-outs, MTA-STS implements the <spanx style="verb">none</spanx> mode, which allows
validated policies to indicate authoritatively that the policy domain wishes to
no longer implement MTA-STS and may, in the future, remove the MTA-STS TXT and
policy endpoints entirely.
</t>
<t>A suggested workflow to implement such an opt out is as follows:
</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>Publish a new policy with <spanx style="verb">mode</spanx> equal to <spanx style="verb">none</spanx> and a small <spanx style="verb">max_age</spanx> (e.g.,
one day).</t>
<t>Publish a new TXT record to trigger fetching of the new policy.</t>
<t>When all previously served policies have expired--normally this is the time
the previously published policy was last served plus that policy's <spanx style="verb">max_age</spanx>,
but note that older policies may have been served with a greater <spanx style="verb">max_age</spanx>,
allowing overlapping policy caches--safely remove the TXT record and HTTPS
endpoint.</t>

<section anchor="preserving-mx-candidate-traversal" title="Preserving MX Candidate Traversal">
<t>Implementors of send-time MTA-STS validation in mail transfer agents should take
note of the risks of modifying the logic of traversing MX candidate lists.
Because an MTA-STS policy can be used to prefilter invalid MX candidates from
the MX candidate list, it is tempting to implement a &quot;two-pass&quot; model, where MX
candidates are first filtered for possible validity according to the MTA-STS
policy, and then the remaining candidates attempted in order as without an
MTA-STS policy.  This may lead to incorrect implementations, such a message
loops; implementors are instead recommended to traverse the MX candidate list as
usual, and treat invalid candidates as though they were unreachable (i.e., as
though there were some transient error when trying to deliver to that
candidate).
</t>
<t>One consequence of validating MX hosts in order of ordinary candidate traversal
is that, in the event that a higher-priority MX is MTA-STS valid and a
lower-priority MX is not, senders may never encounter the lower-priority MX,
leading to a risk that policy misconfigurations that apply only to &quot;backup&quot; MXes
may only be discovered in the case of primary MX failure.

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">
<t>SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security attempts to protect against an active
attacker trying to intercept or tamper with mail between hosts who support
STARTTLS.  There are two classes of attacks considered:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Foiling TLS negotiation, for example by deleting the &quot;250 STARTTLS&quot; response
from a server or altering TLS session negotiation.  This would result in the
SMTP session occurring over plaintext, despite both parties supporting TLS.</t>
<t>Impersonating the destination mail server, whereby the sender might deliver
the message to an impostor, who could then monitor and/or modify messages
despite opportunistic TLS.  This impersonation could be accomplished by
spoofing the DNS MX record for the recipient domain, or by redirecting client
connections intended for the legitimate recipient server (for example, by
altering BGP routing tables).</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>MTA-STS can thwart such attacks only if the sender is able to previously obtain
and cache a policy for the recipient domain, and only if the attacker is unable
to obtain a valid certificate that complies with that policy.  Below, we
consider specific attacks on this model.
</t>

<section anchor="obtaining-a-signed-certificate" title="Obtaining a Signed Certificate">
<t>SMTP MTA-STS relies on certificate validation via PKIX based TLS identity
checking <xref target="RFC6125"/>.  Attackers who are able to obtain a valid certificate for
the targeted recipient mail service (e.g., by compromising a certificate
authority) are thus able to circumvent STS authentication.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="preventing-policy-discovery" title="Preventing Policy Discovery">
<t>Since MTA-STS uses DNS TXT records for policy discovery, an attacker who is able
to block DNS responses can suppress the discovery of an MTA-STS Policy, making
the Policy Domain appear not to have an MTA-STS Policy.  The sender policy cache
is designed to resist this attack by decreasing the frequency of policy
discovery and thus reducing the window of vulnerability; it is nonetheless a
risk that attackers who can predict or induce policy discovery--for example, by
inducing a sending domain to send mail to a never-before-contacted recipient
while carrying out a man-in-the-middle attack--may be able to foil policy
discovery and effectively downgrade the security of the message delivery.
</t>
<t>Since this attack depends upon intercepting initial policy discovery, we
strongly recommend implementers to prefer policy <spanx style="verb">max_age</spanx> values to be as long
as is practical.
</t>
<t>Because this attack is also possible upon refresh of a cached policy, we suggest
implementers do not wait until a cached policy has expired before checking for
an update; if senders attempt to refresh the cache regularly (for example, by
fetching currently live policy in a background task that runs daily or weekly,
regardless of the state of the <spanx style="verb">_mta_sts</spanx> TXT record, and updating their cache's
&quot;max age&quot; accordingly), an attacker would have to foil policy discovery
consistently over the lifetime of a cached policy to prevent a successful
refresh.
</t>
<t>Additionally, MTAs should alert administrators to repeated policy refresh
failures long before cached policies expire (through warning logs or similar
applicable mechanisms), allowing administrators to detect such a persistent
attack on policy refresh.  (However, they should not implement such alerts if
the cached policy has a <spanx style="verb">none</spanx> mode, to allow clean MTA-STS removal, as
described in <xref target="removing-mtasts"/>.)
</t>
<t>Resistance to downgrade attacks of this nature--due to the ability to
authoritatively determine &quot;lack of a record&quot; even for non-participating
recipients--is a feature of DANE, due to its use of DNSSEC for policy discovery.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="denial-of-service" title="Denial of Service">
<t>We additionally consider the Denial of Service risk posed by an attacker who can
modify the DNS records for a recipient domain.  Absent MTA-STS, such an attacker
can cause a sending MTA to cache invalid MX records, but only for however long
the sending resolver caches those records.  With MTA-STS, the attacker can
additionally advertise a new, long-<spanx style="verb">max_age</spanx> MTA-STS policy with <spanx style="verb">mx</spanx>
constraints that validate the malicious MX record, causing senders to cache the
policy and refuse to deliver messages once the victim has resecured the MX
records.
</t>
<t>This attack is mitigated in part by the ability of a victim domain to (at any
time) publish a new policy updating the cached, malicious policy, though this
does require the victim domain to both obtain a valid CA-signed certificate and
to understand and properly configure MTA-STS.
</t>
<t>Similarly, we consider the possibility of domains that deliberately allow
untrusted users to serve untrusted content on user-specified subdomains.  In
some cases (e.g., the service Tumblr.com) this takes the form of providing HTTPS
hosting of user-registered subdomains; in other cases (e.g. dynamic DNS
providers) this takes the form of allowing untrusted users to register custom
DNS records at the provider's domain.
</t>
<t>In these cases, there is a risk that untrusted users would be able to serve
custom content at the <spanx style="verb">mta-sts</spanx> host, including serving an illegitimate MTA-STS
policy.  We believe this attack is rendered more difficult by the need for the
attacker to also serve the <spanx style="verb">_mta-sts</spanx> TXT record on the same domain--something
not, to our knowledge, widely provided to untrusted users.  This attack is
additionally mitigated by the aforementioned ability for a victim domain to
update an invalid policy at any future date.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="weak-policy-constraints" title="Weak Policy Constraints">
<t>Even if an attacker cannot modify a served policy, the potential exists for
configurations that allow attackers on the same domain to receive mail for that
domain.  For example, an easy configuration option when authoring an MTA-STS
Policy for <spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx> is to set the <spanx style="verb">mx</spanx> equal to <spanx style="verb">.example.com</spanx>; recipient
domains must consider in this case the risk that any user possessing a valid
hostname and CA-signed certificate (for example, <spanx style="verb">dhcp-123.example.com</spanx>) will,
from the perspective of MTA-STS Policy validation, be a valid MX host for that
domain.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="compromise-of-the-web-pki-system" title="Compromise of the Web PKI System">
<t>A host of risks apply to the PKI system used for certificate authentication,
both of the <spanx style="verb">mta-sts</spanx> HTTPS host's certificate and the SMTP servers'
certificates.  These risks are broadly applicable within the Web PKI ecosystem
and are not specific to MTA-STS; nonetheless, they deserve some consideration in
this context.
</t>
<t>Broadly speaking, attackers may compromise the system by obtaining certificates
under fraudulent circumstances (i.e., by impersonating the legitimate owner of
the victim domain), by compromising a Certificate Authority or Delegate
Authority's private keys, by obtaining a legitimate certificate issued to the
victim domain, and similar.
</t>
<t>One approach commonly employed by Web browsers to help mitigate against some of
these attacks is to allow for revocation of compromised or fraudulent
certificates via OCSP <xref target="RFC6960"/> or CRLs <xref target="RFC6818"/>.  Such mechanisms
themselves represent tradeoffs and are not universally implemented; we
nonetheless recommend implementors of MTA-STS to implement revocation mechanisms
which are most applicable to their implementations.
