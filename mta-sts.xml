<abstract>
<t>SMTP MTA-STS is a mechanism enabling mail service providers to declare their
ability to receive TLS-secured connections, an expectated validity of
certificates presented by their MX hosts, and to request that sending SMTP
servers report upon and/or refuse to deliver messages that cannot be delivered
securely.
</t>
</abstract>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>The STARTTLS extension to SMTP <xref target="RFC3207"/> allows SMTP clients and hosts to
negotiate the use of a TLS channel for secure mail transmission.
</t>
<t>While such <spanx style="emph">opportunistic</spanx> encryption protocols provide a high barrier against
passive man-in-the-middle traffic interception, any attacker who can delete
parts of the SMTP session (such as the &quot;250 STARTTLS&quot; response) or who can
redirect the entire SMTP session (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record
of the delivery domain) can perform downgrade or interception attacks.
</t>
<t>This document defines a mechanism for recipient domains to publish policies
specifying:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>whether MTAs sending mail to this domain can expect TLS support</t>
<t>expected validity of server certificates presented by the domain's MX hosts</t>
<t>what a conforming client should do with messages when TLS cannot be
 successfully negotiated</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>The mechanism described is separated into four logical components:
</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>policy semantics: whether senders can expect a server for the
  recipient domain to support TLS encryption</t>
<t>policy discovery &amp; authentication: how to discover a domain's published
  policy</t>
<t>policy validation: how to authenticate the published policy</t>
<t>failure handling: what sending MTAs should do in the case of policy
  failures</t>
</list>
</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
<t>The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT,
SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when
they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
<t>We also define the following terms for further use in this document:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>STS Policy: A committment by the Policy Domain to support PKIX authenticated
TLS for the specified MX hosts.</t>
<t>Policy Domain: The domain for which an STS Policy is defined. (For
example, when sending mail to &quot;alice@example.com&quot;, the policy domain is
&quot;example.com&quot;.)</t>
<t>Policy Authentication: Authentication of the STS policy retrieved for a recipient
domain by the sender.</t>
</list>
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="related-technologies" title="Related Technologies">
<t>The DANE TLSA record <xref target="RFC7672"/> is similar, in that DANE is also designed to
upgrade opportunistic, unauthenticated encryption into required, authenticated
encryption. DANE requires DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4033"/> for authentication; the mechanism
described here instead relies on certificate authorities (CAs) and does not
require DNSSEC.  For a thorough discussion of this trade-off, see the section
<spanx style="emph">Security</spanx> <spanx style="emph">Considerations</spanx>.
</t>
<t>In addition, SMTP MTA-STS provides an optional report-only mode, enabling soft
deployments to detect policy failures.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="policy-semantics" title="Policy Semantics">
<t>SMTP MTA-STS policies are distributed via a &quot;well known&quot; HTTPS endpoint in the
Policy Domain. A corresponding TXT record in the DNS signals to sending MTAs the
presence of a policy file. The character content of the TXT record is encoded as
US-ASCII.
</t>
<t>The MTA-STS TXT record MUST specify the following fields:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t><spanx style="verb">v</spanx>: (plain-text, required). Currently only &quot;STSv1&quot; is supported.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">id</spanx>: (plain-text, required). A short string used to track policy updates.
This string MUST uniquely identify a given instance of a policy, such that
senders can determine when the policy has been updated by comparing to the <spanx style="verb">id</spanx>
of a previously seen policy. There is no implied ordering of <spanx style="verb">id</spanx> fields
between revisions.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Policies MUST specify the following fields in JSON <xref target="RFC4627"/> format:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t><spanx style="verb">version</spanx>: (plain-text, required). Currently only &quot;STSv1&quot; is supported.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">mode</spanx>: (plain-text, required). Either &quot;enforce&quot; or &quot;report&quot;, indicating the
expected behavior of a sending MTA in the case of a policy validation failure.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">mx</spanx>: MX patterns (list of plain-text MX match patterns, required). One or
more patterns matching the expected MX for this domain. For example,
<spanx style="verb">["*.example.com", "*.example.net"]</spanx> indicates that mail for this domain might
be handled by any MX with a hostname at <spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">example.net</spanx>.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">max_age</spanx>: Max lifetime of the policy (plain-text positive integer seconds).
Well-behaved clients SHOULD cache a policy for up to this value from last
policy fetch time.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>A lenient parser SHOULD accept TXT record sand policy files which are
syntactically valid (i.e. valid key-value pairs or valid JSON) implementing a
superset of this specification, in which case unknown values SHALL be ignored.

<section anchor="policy-expiration" title="Policy Expiration">
<t>In order to resist attackers inserting a fraudulent policy, SMTP MTA-STS
policies are designed to be long-lived, with an expiry typically greater than
two weeks.  Policy validity is controlled by the lifetime indicated in the
policy (&quot;max_age=&quot;). Senders SHOULD cache a policy (and apply it to all mail to
the recipient domain) until the policy expiration.
</t>
<t>To mitigate the risks of long-lived cached policies (which otherwise may make it
difficult for recipient domains to change infrastructure in ways which the
policy forbids), domains can, at any time, publish an updated policy. As
described in <spanx style="emph">Policy</spanx> <spanx style="emph">Application</spanx>, senders MUST fetch a new policy before
treating a validation failure as a permanent delivery failure.
</t>

<section anchor="policy-updates" title="Policy Updates">
<t>Updating the policy requires that the owner make changes in two places: the
<spanx style="verb">_mta_sts</spanx> TXT record in the Policy Domain's DNS zone and at the corresponding
HTTPS endpoint. In the case where the HTTPS endpoint has been updated but the
TXT record has not been, senders will not know there is a new policy released
and may thus continue to use old, previously cached versions.  Recipients should
thus expect a policy will continue to be used by senders until both the HTTPS
and TXT endpoints are updated and the TXT record's TTL has passed.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="policy-revocation" title="Policy Revocation">
<t>Senders MUST treat a policy with a max_age of 0 as a revocation: they should
purge any previously cached policy and proceed to deliver mail to the recipient
domain as though it never had an STS policy.
</t>
</section>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="policy-discovery--authentication" title="Policy Discovery &amp; Authentication">
<t>Senders discover a recipient domain's MTA-STS policy by fetching a TXT record
with the name generated by prefixing <spanx style="verb">_mta_sts</spanx> to the recipient domain. A valid
TXT record at <spanx style="verb">_mta_sts.example.com</spanx> indicates that the domain <spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx>
supports MTA-STS.
</t>
<t>When sending to a recipient domain for which a valid TXT record exists, a
compliant sender will then fetch via the GET method an HTTPS resource containing
the policy body from a host at the <spanx style="verb">mta-sts</spanx> host of the policy domain, using an
<xref target="RFC5785"/> &quot;well-known&quot; path of <spanx style="verb">.well-known/mta-sts.json</spanx>.  For
<spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx>, this would be
<spanx style="verb">https://mta-sts.example.com/.well-known/mta-sts.json</spanx>.
</t>

<section anchor="https-policy-fetching" title="HTTPS Policy Fetching">
<t>When fetching a new policy or updating a policy, the HTTPS endpoint MUST present
a TLS certificate which is valid for the <spanx style="verb">mta-sts</spanx> host (as described in
<xref target="RFC6125"/>), chain to a root CA that is trusted by the sending CA, and be
non-expired. It is expected that sending MTAs use a set of trusted CAs similar
to those in widely deployed Web browsers and operating systems.
</t>
<t>HTTP 3xx redirects MUST NOT be followed.
</t>
<t>Senders may wish to rate-limit the frequency of attempts to fetch the HTTPS
endpoint even if a valid TXT record for the recipient domain exists. In the case
that the HTTPS GET fails, we suggest implementions may limit further attempts to
a period of five minutes or longer per version ID, to avoid overwhelming
resource-constrained recipients with cascading failures.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="policy-selection-for-smart-hosts" title="Policy Selection for Smart Hosts">
<t>When sending mail via a &quot;smart host&quot;--an intermediate SMTP relay rather than the
message recipient's server--compliant senders MUST treat the smart host domain
as the policy domain for the purposes of policy discovery and application.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="policy-validation" title="Policy Validation">
<t>When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid and
non-expired SMTP MTA-STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP MTA-STS MUST
validate:
</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>That the recipient MX matches the <spanx style="verb">mx</spanx> pattern from the recipient
domain's policy.</t>
<t>That the recipient MX supports STARTTLS and offers a valid PKIX based TLS
certificate.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>This section does not dictate the behavior of sending MTAs when policies fail to
validate; in particular, validation failures of policies which specify &quot;report
only&quot; mode MUST NOT be interpreted as delivery failures, as described in the
section <spanx style="emph">Policy</spanx> <spanx style="emph">Application</spanx>.
</t>

<section anchor="mx-matching" title="MX Matching">
<t>When delivering mail for the Policy Domain to a recipient MX host, the sender
validates the MX match against the <spanx style="verb">mx</spanx> pattern from the applied policy. The
semantics for these patterns are those found in section 6.4 of <xref target="RFC6125"/>.
</t>
<t>Patterns may contain a wildcard character <spanx style="verb">*</spanx> which matches any single domain
name component or component fragment, though only as the leftmost component in a
pattern. For example, <spanx style="verb">*.example.com</spanx> is a valid pattern, but
<spanx style="verb">foo.*.example.com</spanx> is not. Given the pattern <spanx style="verb">*.example.com</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">mx1.example.com</spanx>
is a valid MX host, but <spanx style="verb">1234.dhcp.example.com</spanx> is not.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="mx-certificate-validation" title="MX Certificate Validation">
<t>The certificate presented by the receiving MX MUST be valid for the MX hostname
and chain to a root CA that is trusted by the sending MTA. The certificate MUST
have a CN or SAN matching the MX hostname (as described in <xref target="RFC6125"/>) and be
non-expired.
</t>
<t>In the case of an &quot;implicit&quot; MX record (as specified in <xref target="RFC2821"/>) where no MX
RR exists for the recipient domain but there is an A RR, the MX hostname is
assumed to be that of the A RR and should be validated as such.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="policy-application" title="Policy Application">
<t>When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid, non-expired
STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP MTA-STS applies the result of a policy
validation one of two ways, depending on the value of the policy <spanx style="verb">mode</spanx> field:
</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t><spanx style="verb">report</spanx>: In this mode, sending MTAs merely send a report (as described in the
TLSRPT specification (TODO: add ref)) indicating policy application
failures. This can be used for &quot;soft&quot; deployments, to ensure a policy will not
cause domain-wide mail delivery failures while being adopted or during
infrastructure changes.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">enforce</spanx>: In this mode, sending MTAs treat STS policy failures as a mail
delivery error, and MUST NOT deliver the message to this host. However, note
that MTAs that honor <spanx style="verb">enforce</spanx> mode MUST first check for the existing of an
updated, authenticated policy before <spanx style="emph">permanently</spanx> failing messages. This is
to ensure that failures only occur if a sending MTA is in fact validating
against the most recent version of the recipient domain's policy.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Note that despite the presence of an <spanx style="verb">enforce</spanx> policy, STS-aware sending MTAs
may in some cases choose to deliver mail to non-validating MXes due to external
reasons, such as an inability to enforce STS at send-time (i.e., some domains
may validate STS policies offline and only choose to report failures) or
concerns about the completeness of their own trusted CA list.
</t>
<t>Finally, an STS Policy MUST NOT be be used to reject mail until it has been
successfully validated when delivering at least one message to the Policy
Domain. This is to limit the risk of misconfigurations when deploying new
policies.
</t>

<section anchor="mx-preference" title="MX Preference">
<t>When applying a policy, sending MTAs SHOULD select recipient MXs by first
eliminating any MXs at lower priority than the current host (if in the MX
candidate set), then eliminating any non-matching (as specified by the STS
policy) MX hosts from the candidate MX set, and then attempting delivery to
matching hosts as indicated by their MX priority, until delivery succeeds or the
MX candidate set is empty.
</t>
<t>If none of the attempted MX hosts validate according to the policy, the policy
MUST be refreshed at least once, as described in <spanx style="emph">Policy</spanx> <spanx style="emph">Discovery</spanx> <spanx style="emph">&amp;</spanx>
<spanx style="emph">Authentication</spanx>, before a message should be permanently rejected. (In the case
of policies in &quot;report&quot; mode, the sending MTA may simply fall back to the
original candidate MX set.)
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="policy-application-control-flow" title="Policy Application Control Flow">
<t>The control flow for a sending MTA consists of the following steps:
</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>Check for a cached, non-expired policy. If none exists and the <spanx style="verb">_mta_sts</spanx> TXT
record is present for the recipient domain, fetch a new policy, authenticate,

<t>Validate candidate MX or MXs against policy. If a valid MX is discovered,

<t>If no valid recipient MX is found, the cached policy mode is <spanx style="verb">enforce</spanx>, and
the cached policy has previously been successfully applied, temporarily fail
the message.</t>
<t>Upon message retries, a message MAY be permanently failed following first

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">
<t>SMTP Strict Transport Security attempts to protect against an active attacker
who wishes to intercept or tamper with mail between hosts who support STARTTLS.
There are two classes of attacks considered:
</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>Foiling TLS negotiation, for example by deleting the &quot;250 STARTTLS&quot; response
from a server or altering TLS session negotiation. This would result in the
SMTP session occurring over plaintext, despite both parties supporting TLS.</t>
<t>Impersonating the destination mail server, whereby the sender might deliver
the message to an impostor, who could then monitor and/or modify messages
despite opportunistic TLS. This impersonation could be accomplished by
spoofing the DNS MX record for the recipient domain, or by redirecting client
connections intended for the legitimate recipient server (for example, by
altering BGP routing tables).</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>SMTP Strict Transport Security relies on certificate validation via PKIX based TLS
identity checking <xref target="RFC6125"/>. Attackers who are able to obtain a valid certificate
for the targeted recipient mail service (e.g. by compromising a certificate authority)
are thus able to circumvent STS authentication.
</t>
<t>Since we use DNS TXT record for policy discovery, an attacker who is able to
block DNS responses can suppress the discovery of an STS Policy, making the
Policy Domain appear not to have an STS Policy. The caching model described in
<spanx style="emph">Policy</spanx> <spanx style="emph">Expirations</spanx> is designed to resist this attack.
</t>
<t>We additionally consider the Denial of Service risk posed by an attacker who can
modify the DNS records for a victim domain. Absent SMTP STS, such an attacker
can cause a sending MTA to cache invalid MX records for a long TTL. With SMTP
STS, the attacker can additionally advertise a new SMTP STS policy with
never-satisfied <spanx style="verb">mx</spanx> constraints and a long <spanx style="verb">max_age</spanx>.
</t>
<t>This attack is mitigated in part by the ability of a victim domain to (at any
time) publish a new policy updating or revoking the cached, malicious policy;
this does, however, require the victim domain to both obtain a valid CA-signed
certificate and to understand and properly configure SMTP STS.
</t>
<t>Similarly, we consider the possibilty of domains that deliberately allow
untrusted users to serve untrusted content on user-specified subdomains. In some
cases (e.g. the service Tumblr.com) this takes the form of providing HTTPS
hosting of user-registered subdomains; in other cases (e.g. dynamic DNS
providers) this takes the form of allowing untrusted users to register custom
DNS records at the provider's domain.
</t>
<t>In these cases, there is a risk that untrusted users would be able to serve
custom content at the <spanx style="verb">mta-sts</spanx> host, including serving an illegitimate SMTP STS
policy.  We believe this attack is mitigated in part by the need for the
attacker to also serve the <spanx style="verb">_mta_sts</spanx> TXT record on the same domain--something
not, to our knowledge, widely provided to untrusted users--and by the
aforementioned ability for a victim domain to revoke an invalid policy at any
future date.
</t>
<t>Even if an attacker cannot modify a served policy, the potential exists for
configurations that allow attackers on the same domain to receive mail for that
domain. For example, an easy configuration option when authoring an STS Policy
for <spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx> is to set the <spanx style="verb">mx</spanx> equal to <spanx style="verb">*.example.com</spanx>; recipient domains
must consider in this case the risk that any user possessing a valid hostname
and CA-signed certificate (for example, <spanx style="verb">dhcp-123.example.com</spanx>) will, from the
perspective of STS Policy validation, be a valid MX host for that domain.
