                           SMTP TLS Reporting
                     draft-ietf-uta-smtp-tlsrpt-23

Abstract

   A number of protocols exist for establishing encrypted channels
   between SMTP Mail Transfer Agents, including STARTTLS, DANE TLSA, and
   MTA-STS.  These protocols can fail due to misconfiguration or active
   attack, leading to undelivered messages or delivery over unencrypted
   or unauthenticated channels.  This document describes a reporting
   mechanism and format by which sending systems can share statistics
   and specific information about potential failures with recipient
   domains.  Recipient domains can then use this information to both
   detect potential attacks and diagnose unintentional
   misconfigurations.

1.  Introduction

   The STARTTLS extension to SMTP [RFC3207] allows SMTP clients and
   hosts to establish secure SMTP sessions over TLS.  The protocol
   design uses an approach that has come to be known as "Opportunistic
   Security" (OS) [RFC7435].  This method maintains interoperability
   with clients that do not support STARTTLS, but means that any
   attacker could potentially eavesdrop on a session.  An attacker could
   perform a downgrade or interception attack by deleting parts of the
   SMTP session (such as the "250 STARTTLS" response) or redirect the
   entire SMTP session (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record of
   the delivery domain).

   Because such "downgrade attacks" are not necessarily apparent to the
   receiving MTA, this document defines a mechanism for sending domains
   to report on failures at multiple stages of the MTA-to-MTA
   conversation.

   Recipient domains may also use the mechanisms defined by MTA-STS
   [I-D.ietf-uta-mta-sts] or DANE [RFC6698] to publish additional
   encryption and authentication requirements; this document defines a
   mechanism for sending domains that are compatible with MTA-STS or
   DANE to share success and failure statistics with recipient domains.

   Specifically, this document defines a reporting schema that covers
   failures in routing, DNS resolution, STARTTLS negotiation, and both
   DANE [RFC6698] and MTA-STS [I-D.ietf-uta-mta-sts] policy validation
   errors, and a standard TXT record that recipient domains can use to
   indicate where reports in this format should be sent.  The report can
   also serve as a heartbeat that systems are successfully negotiating
   TLS during sessions as expected.

Internet-Draft                 SMTP-TLSRPT                     June 2018


   This document is intended as a companion to the specification for
   SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security [I-D.ietf-uta-mta-sts], as well as
   adds reporting abilities for those implementing DANE [RFC7672].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [BCP 14] [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   We also define the following terms for further use in this document:

   o  MTA-STS Policy: A mechanism by which administrators can specify
      the expected TLS availability, presented identity, and desired
      actions for a given email recipient domain.  MTA-STS is defined in
      [I-D.ietf-uta-mta-sts].

   o  DANE Policy: A mechanism by which administrators can use DNSSEC to
      commit an MTA to support STARTTLS and to publish criteria to be
      used to validate its presented certificates.  DANE for SMTP is
      defined in [RFC7672], with the base specification in [RFC6698]
      (updated in [RFC7671].

   o  TLSRPT Policy: A policy specifying the endpoint to which sending
      MTAs should deliver reports.

   o  Policy Domain: The domain against which an MTA-STS or DANE Policy
      is defined.  For MTA-STS this is typically the same as the
      envelope recipient domain [RFC5321], but when mail is routed to a
      "smarthost" gateway by local policy, the "smarthost" domain name
      is used instead.  For DANE the Policy Domain is the "TLSA base
      domain" of the receiving SMTP server as described in RFC7672 [1]
      and RFC6698 [2].

   o  Sending MTA: The MTA initiating the relay of an email message.

   o  Aggregate Report URI (rua): A comma-separated list of locations
      where the report is to be submitted.

2.  Related Technologies

   o  This document is intended as a companion to the specification for

   o  SMTP-TLSRPT defines a mechanism for sending domains that are

      statistics with recipient domains.  DANE is defined in [RFC6698]
      and MTA-STS is defined in [I-D.ietf-uta-mta-sts].

3.  Reporting Policy

   A domain publishes a record to its DNS indicating that it wishes to
   receive reports.  These SMTP TLSRPT policies are distributed via DNS
   from the Policy Domain's zone, as TXT records (similar to DMARC
   policies) under the name "_smtp._tls".  For example, for the Policy
   Domain "example.com", the recipient's TLSRPT policy can be retrieved
   from "_smtp._tls.example.com".

   Policies consist of the following directives:

   o  "v": This document defines version 1 of TLSRPT, for which this
      value MUST be equal to "TLSRPTv1".  Other versions may be defined
      in later documents.

   o  "rua": A URI specifying the endpoint to which aggregate
      information about policy validation results should be sent (see
      Section 4, "Reporting Schema", for more information).  Two URI
      schemes are supported: "mailto" and "https".  As with DMARC
      [RFC7489], the policy domain can specify a comma-separated list of
      URIs.

   o  In the case of "https", reports should be submitted via POST
      ([RFC7231]) to the specified URI.  Report submitters MAY ignore
      certificate validation errors when submitting reports via https.

   o  In the case of "mailto", reports should be submitted to the
      specified email address ([RFC6068]).  When sending failure reports
      via SMTP, sending MTAs MUST deliver reports despite any TLS-
      related failures and SHOULD NOT include this SMTP session in the
      next report.  When sending failure reports via HTTPS, sending MTAs
      MAY deliver reports despite any TLS-related faliures.  This may
      mean that the reports are delivered in the clear.  Reports sent
      via SMTP MUST contain a valid DKIM [RFC6376] signature by the
      reporting domain.  Reports lacking such a signature MUST be
      ignored by the recipient.  DKIM signatures must not use the "l="
      attribute to limit the body length used in the signature.  The
      DKIM TXT record must contain the appropriate service type
      declaration, "s=tlsrpt", and if not present the receiving system
      SHOULD ignore reports signed using this record.

   The formal definition of the "_smtp._tls" TXT record, defined using
   [RFC5234] & [RFC7405], is as follows:

                            [field-delim]

        field-delim       = *WSP ";" *WSP

        tlsrpt-field      = tlsrpt-rua /        ; Note that the

                            ; "URI" is imported from [RFC3986];
                            ; commas (ASCII 0x2C), exclamation
                            ; points (ASCII 0x21), and semicolons
                            ; (ASCII 0x3B) MUST be encoded

        tlsrpt-extension  = tlsrpt-ext-name "=" tlsrpt-ext-value

        tlsrpt-ext-name   = (ALPHA / DIGIT) *31(ALPHA /
                            DIGIT / "_" / "-" / ".")

        tlsrpt-ext-value  = 1*(%x21-3A / %x3C / %x3E-7E)
                            ; chars excluding "=", ";", SP, and control
                            ; chars

   If multiple TXT records for "_smtp._tls" are returned by the
   resolver, records which do not begin with "v=TLSRPTv1;" are
   discarded.  If the number of resulting records is not one, senders
   MUST assume the recipient domain does not implement TLSRPT.  If the
   resulting TXT record contains multiple strings (as described in
   Section 3.1.3 of [RFC4408]), then the record MUST be treated as if
   those strings are concatenated together without adding spaces.

   The record supports the abillity to declare more than one rua, and if
   there exists more than one, the reporter MAY attempt to deliver to
   each of the supported rua destinations.  A receiver MAY opt to only
   attempt delivery to one of the endpoints, however the report SHOULD
   NOT be considered successfully delivered until one of the endpoints
   accepts delivery of the report.

   Parsers MUST accept TXT records which are syntactically valid (i.e.
   valid key-value pairs separated by semi-colons) and implementing a
   superset of this specification, in which case unknown fields SHALL be
   ignored.

3.1.  Example Reporting Policy

3.1.1.  Report using MAILTO

            _smtp._tls.example.com. IN TXT \
                    "v=TLSRPTv1;rua=mailto:reports@example.com"

3.1.2.  Report using HTTPS

           _smtp._tls.example.com. IN TXT \
                   "v=TLSRPTv1; \
                   rua=https://reporting.example.com/v1/tlsrpt"

4.  Reporting Schema

   The report is composed as a plain text file encoded in the I-JSON
   format ([RFC7493]).

   Aggregate reports contain the following fields:

   o  Report metadata:

      *  The organization responsible for the report

      *  Contact information for one or more responsible parties for the
         contents of the report

      *  A unique identifier for the report

      *  The reporting date range for the report

   o  Policy, consisting of:

      *  One of the following policy types: (1) The MTA-STS policy
         applied (as a string) (2) The DANE TLSA record applied (as a
         string, with each RR entry of the RRset listed and separated by
         a semicolon) (3) The literal string "no-policy-found", if
         neither a DANE nor MTA-STS policy could be found.

      *  The domain for which the policy is applied

      *  The MX host

   o  Aggregate counts, comprising result type, sending MTA IP,
      receiving MTA hostname, session count, and an optional additional
      information field containing a URI for recipients to review
      further information on a failure type.

   Note that the failure types are non-exclusive; an aggregate report
   may contain overlapping "counts" of failure types when a single send
   attempt encountered multiple errors.  Reporters may report multiple
   applied policies (for example, an MTA-STS policy and a DANE TLSA
   record for the same domain and MX).  Because of this, even in the
   case where only a single policy was applied, the "policies" field of
   the report body MUST be an array and not a singular value.

   In the case of multiple failure types, the "failure-details" array
   would contain multiple entries.  Each entry would have its own set of
   infomation pertaining to that failure type.

4.1.  Report Time-frame

   The report SHOULD cover a full day, from 0000-2400 UTC.  This should
   allow for easier correlation of failure events.  To avoid a Denial of
   Service against the system processing the reports, the reports should
   be delivered after some delay, perhaps several hours.

   As an example, a sending site might want to introduce a random delay
   of up to four hours:

          func generate_sleep_delay() {
            min_delay = 1
            max_delay = 14400
            rand = random(min_delay,max_delay)
            return rand
          }

          func generate_report(policy_domain) {
            do_rpt_work(policy_domain)
            send_rpt(policy_domain)
          }

          func generate_tlsrpt() {
            sleep(generate_sleep_delay())
            for policy_domain in list_of_tlsrpt_enabled_domains {
              generate_report(policy_domain)
            }
          }

   A sending site might wish to introduce a random delay per destination
   site, up to four hours:

4.2.  Delivery Summary

4.2.1.  Success Count

   o  "total-successful-session-count": This indicates that the sending
      MTA was able to successfully negotiate a policy-compliant TLS
      connection, and serves to provide a "heartbeat" to receiving
      domains that reporting is functional and tabulating correctly.
      This field contains an aggregate count of successful connections
      for the reporting system.

4.2.2.  Failure Count

   o  "total-failure-session-count": This indicates that the sending MTA
      was unable to successfully establish a connection with the
      receiving platform.  Section 4.3, "Result Types", will elaborate
      on the failed negotiation attempts.  This field contains an
      aggregate count of failed connections.

4.3.  Result Types

   The list of result types will start with the minimal set below, and
   is expected to grow over time based on real-world experience.  The
   initial set is:

4.3.1.  Negotiation Failures

   o  "starttls-not-supported": This indicates that the recipient MX did
      not support STARTTLS.

   o  "certificate-host-mismatch": This indicates that the certificate
      presented did not adhere to the constraints specified in the MTA-
      STS or DANE policy, e.g.  if the MX hostname does not match any
      identities listed in the Subject Alternate Name (SAN) [RFC5280].

   o  "certificate-expired": This indicates that the certificate has
      expired.

   o  "certificate-not-trusted": This a label that covers multiple
      certificate related failures that include, but not limited to
      errors such as untrusted/unknown CAs, certificate name
      constraints, certificate chain errors etc.  When using this
      declaration, the reporting MTA SHOULD utilize the "failure-reason-
      code" to provide more information to the receiving entity.

   o  "validation-failure": This indicates a general failure for a
      reason not matching a category above.  When using this
      declaration, the reporting MTA SHOULD utilize the "failure-reason-
      code" to provide more information to the receiving entity.

4.3.2.  Policy Failures

4.3.2.1.  DANE-specific Policy Failures

   o  "tlsa-invalid": This indicates a validation error in the TLSA
      record associated with a DANE policy.  None of the records in the
      RRset were found to be valid.

   o  "dnssec-invalid": This would indicate that no valid records were
      returned from the recursive resolver.  The request returned with
      SERVFAIL for the requested TLSA record.

   o  "dane-required": This indicates that the sending system is
      configured to require DANE TLSA records for all the MX hosts of
      the destination domain, but no DNSSEC-validated TLSA records were
      present for the MX host that is the subject of the report.
      Mandatory DANE for SMTP is described in section 6 of [RFC7672].
      Such policies may be created by mutual agreement between two
      organizations that frequently exchange sensitive content via
      email.

4.3.2.2.  MTA-STS-specific Policy Failures

   o  "sts-policy-invalid": This indicates a validation error for the
      overall MTA-STS policy.

   o  "sts-webpki-invalid": This indicates that the MTA-STS policy could
      not be authenticated using PKIX validation.

4.3.3.  General Failures

   When a negotiation failure can not be categorized into one of the
   "Negotiation Failures" stated above, the reporter SHOULD use the
   "validation-failure" category.  As TLS grows and becomes more
   complex, new mechanisms may not be easily categorized.  This allows
   for a generic feedback category.  When this category is used, the
   reporter SHOULD also use the "failure-reason-code" to give some
   feedback to the receiving entity.  This is intended to be a short
   text field, and the contents of the field should be an error code or
   error text, such as "X509_V_ERR_UNHANDLED_CRITICAL_CRL_EXTENSION".

4.3.4.  Transient Failures

   Transient errors due to too-busy network, TCP timeouts, etc. are not
   required to be reported.

4.4.  JSON Report Schema

   The JSON schema is derived from the HPKP JSON schema [RFC7469] (cf.
   Section 3)

   o  "email-address": The contact information for a responsible party
      of the report.  It is provided as a string formatted according to
      Section 3.4.1, "Addr-Spec", of [RFC5321].

   o  "report-id": A unique identifier for the report.  Report authors
      may use whatever scheme they prefer to generate a unique
      identifier.  It is provided as a string.

   o  "policy-type": The type of policy that was applied by the sending
      domain.  Presently, the only three valid choices are "tlsa",
      "sts", and the literal string "no-policy-found".  It is provided
      as a string.

   o  "policy-string": An encoding of the applied policy as a JSON array
      of strings, whether TLSA record ([RFC6698] section 2.3) or MTA-STS
      policy.  Examples follow in the next section.

   o  "domain": The Policy Domain is the domain against which the MTA-
      STS or DANE policy is defined.  In the case of Internationalized
      Domain Names ([RFC5891]), the domain MUST consist of the Punycode-
      encoded A-labels ([RFC3492]) and not the U-labels.

   o  "mx-host-pattern": The pattern of MX hostnames from the applied
      policy.  It is provided as a string, and is interpreted in the
      same manner as the "Checking of Wildcard Certificates" rules in

      Domain Names ([RFC5891]), the domain MUST consist of the Punycode-
      encoded A-labels ([RFC3492]) and not the U-labels.

   o  "result-type": A value from Section 4.3, "Result Types", above.

   o  "ip-address": The IP address of the sending MTA that attempted the
      STARTTLS connection.  It is provided as a string representation of
      an IPv4 (see below) or IPv6 ([RFC5952]) address in dot-decimal or
      colon-hexadecimal notation.

   o  "receiving-mx-hostname": The hostname of the receiving MTA MX
      record with which the sending MTA attempted to negotiate a
      STARTTLS connection.

   o  "receiving-mx-helo": (optional) The HELO or EHLO string from the
      banner announced during the reported session.

   o  "receiving-ip": The destination IP address that was using when
      creating the outbound session.  It is provided as a string
      representation of an IPv4 (see below) or IPv6 ([RFC5952]) address
      in dot-decimal or colon-hexadecimal notation.

   o  "total-successful-session-count": The aggregate count (integer,
      encoded as a JSON number) of successfully negotiated TLS-enabled
      connections to the receiving site.

   o  "total-failure-session-count": The aggregate count (integer,
      encoded as a JSON number) of failures to negotiate a TLS-enabled
      connection to the receiving site.

   o  "failed-session-count": The number of (attempted) sessions that
      match the relevant "result-type" for this section (integer,
      encoded as a JSON number).

   o  "additional-info-uri": An optional URI [RFC3986] pointing to
      additional information around the relevant "result-type".  For
      example, this URI might host the complete certificate chain
      presented during an attempted STARTTLS session.

   o  "failure-reason-code": A text field to include a TLS-related error
      code or error message.

   For report purposes, an IPv4 Address is defined via the following
   ABNF:

     IPv4address = dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet "." dec-octet
     dec-octet     = DIGIT                 ; 0-9
                   / %x31-39 DIGIT         ; 10-99
                   / "1" 2DIGIT            ; 100-199
                   / "2" %x30-34 DIGIT     ; 200-249
                   / "25" %x30-35          ; 250-255

4.5.  Policy Samples

   Part of the report body includes the policy that is applied when
   attemping relay to the destination.

   For DANE TLSA policies, this is a JSON array of strings each
   representing the RDATA of a single TLSA resource record as a space-
   separated list of its four TLSA fields; the fields are in
   presentation format (defined in [RFC6698] Section 2.2) with no
   internal spaces or grouping parentheses:

[
"3 0 1 1F850A337E6DB9C609C522D136A475638CC43E1ED424F8EEC8513D747D1D085D",
"3 0 1 12350A337E6DB9C6123522D136A475638CC43E1ED424F8EEC8513D747D1D1234"
]

   For MTA-STS policies, this is an array of JSON strings that
   represents the policy that is declared by the receiving site,

   including any errors that may be present.  Note that where there are
   multiple "mx" values, they must be listed as separate "mx" elements
   in the policy array, rather as a single nested "mx" sub-array.

                       [
                       "version: STSv1",
                       "mode: testing",
                       "mx: mx1.example.com",
                       "mx: mx2.example.com",
                       "mx: mx.backup-example.com",
                       "max_age: 604800"
                       ]

5.  Report Delivery

   Reports can be delivered either as an email message via SMTP or via
   HTTP POST.

5.1.  Report Filename

   The filename is RECOMMENDED to be constructed using the following
   ABNF:

    filename        = sender "!" policy-domain "!" begin-timestamp
                      "!" end-timestamp [ "!" unique-id ] "." extension

    unique-id       = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT)

    sender          = domain ; From the [RFC5321] that is used
                      ; as the domain for the `contact-info`
                      ; address in the report body

    policy-domain   = domain

    begin-timestamp = 1*DIGIT
                      ; seconds since 00:00:00 UTC January 1, 1970
                      ; indicating start of the time range contained
                      ; in the report

    end-timestamp   = 1*DIGIT
                      ; seconds since 00:00:00 UTC January 1, 1970
                      ; indicating end of the time range contained
                      ; in the report

    extension       = "json" / "json.gz"

   The extension MUST be "json" for a plain JSON file, or "json.gz" for
   a JSON file compressed using GZIP.

   "unique-id" allows an optional unique ID generated by the Sending MTA
   to distinguish among multiple reports generated simultaneously by
   different sources within the same Policy Domain.  For example, this
   is a possible filename for a compressed report to the Policy Domain
   "example.net" from the Sending MTA "mail.sndr.example.com":

   "mail.sndr.example.com!example.net!1470013207!1470186007!001.json.gz"

5.2.  Compression

   The report SHOULD be subjected to GZIP [RFC1952] compression for both
   email and HTTPS transport.  Declining to apply compression can cause
   the report to be too large for a receiver to process (a commonly
   observed receiver limit is ten megabytes); compressing the file
   increases the chances of acceptance of the report at some compute
   cost.

5.3.  Email Transport

   The report MAY be delivered by email.  To make the reports machine-
   parsable for the receivers, we define a top-level media type
   "multipart/report" with a new parameter "report-type="tlsrpt"".
   Inside it, there are two parts: The first part is human readable,
   typically "text/plain", and the second part is machine readable with
   a new media type defined called "application/tlsrpt+json".  If
   compressed, the report should use the media type "application/
   tlsrpt+gzip".

   In addition, the following two new top level message header fields
   are defined:

   "TLS-Report-Domain: Receiver-Domain"

   "TLS-Report-Submitter: Sender-Domain"

   The "TLS-Report-Submitter" value MUST match the value found in the
   [RFC5321] domain from the "contact-info" from the report body.  These
   message headers MUST be included and should allow for easy searching
   for all reports submitted by a report domain or a particular
   submitter, for example in IMAP [RFC3501]:

   "s SEARCH HEADER "TLS-Report-Domain" "example.com""

   It is presumed that the aggregate reporting address will be equipped
   to process new message header fields and extract MIME parts with the
   prescribed media type and filename, and ignore the rest.  These
   additional headers SHOULD be included in the DKIM [RFC6376] signature
   for the message.

   The [RFC5322].Subject field for report submissions SHOULD conform to
   the following ABNF:

       tlsrpt-subject = %s"Report" FWS               ; "Report"
                        %s"Domain:" FWS              ; "Domain:"
                        domain-name FWS              ; per [RFC6376]
                        %s"Submitter:" FWS           ; "Submitter:"
                        domain-name FWS              ; per [RFC6376]
                        %s"Report-ID:" FWS           ; "Report-ID:
                        "<" id-left "@" id-right ">" ; per [RFC5322]
                        [CFWS]                       ; per [RFC5322]
                                                     ; (as with FWS)

   The first domain-name indicates the DNS domain name about which the
   report was generated.  The second domain-name indicates the DNS
   domain name representing the Sending MTA generating the report.  The
   purpose of the Report-ID: portion of the field is to enable the
   Policy Domain to identify and ignore duplicate reports that might be
   sent by a Sending MTA.

   For instance, this is a possible Subject field for a report to the
   Policy Domain "example.net" from the Sending MTA
   "mail.sender.example.com".  It is line-wrapped as allowed by
   [RFC5322]:

              Subject: Report Domain: example.net
                  Submitter: mail.sender.example.com
                  Report-ID: <735ff.e317+bf22029@mailexample.net>

   Note that, when sending failure reports via SMTP, sending MTAs MUST
   NOT honor MTA-STS or DANE TLSA failures.

5.4.  HTTPS Transport

   The report MAY be delivered by POST to HTTPS.  If compressed, the
   report SHOULD use the media type "application/tlsrpt+gzip", and
   "application/tlsrpt+json" otherwise (see section Section 6, "IANA
   Considerations").

   The receiving system MUST return a "successful" response from its
   HTTPS server, typically a 200 or 201 HTTP code [RFC7321].  Other
   codes could indicate a delivery failure, and may be retried as per
   local sender policy.  The receiving system is not expected to process

   reports at receipt time, and MAY store them for processing at a later
   time.

5.5.  Delivery Retry

   In the event of a delivery failure, regardless of the delivery
   method, a sender SHOULD attempt redelivery for up to 24hrs after the
   initial attempt.  As previously stated the reports are optional, so
   while it is ideal to attempt redelivery, it is not required.  If
   multiple retries are attempted, ideally they SHOULD be done with
   exponential backoff.

5.6.  Metadata Variances

   As stated above, there are a variable number of ways to declare
   information about the data therein.  If any of items declared via
   subject or filename disagree with the report, the report MUST be
   considered the authoritative source.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The following are the IANA considerations discussed in this document.

6.1.  Message headers

   Below is the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Permanent
   Message Header Field registration information per [RFC3864].

   The registry name is "Report Type Registry", and the procedure for
   updating the registry will be "Specification Required".

   An entry in this registry should contain:

   o  the report-type being registered

   o  one or more registered media-types that can be used with this
      report-type

   o  the document containing the registration action

   o  an optional comment

   The initial entries are:

   Report-Type: tlsrpt Media Type: application/tlsrpt+gzip, application/
   tlsrpt+json Registered By: [RFCXXXX] Comment: Media types suitable
   for use with this report-type are defined in Sections 6.4 and 6.5 of
   [RFCXXXX]

   Report-Type: disposition-notification Media Type: message/
   disposition-notification Registered By: [RFC8098] Section 10

   Report-Type: disposition-notification Media Type: message/global-
   disposition-notification Registered By: [RFC6533] Section 6

   Report-Type: delivery-status Media Type: message/delivery-status
   Registered By: [RFC3464] Appendix D

   Report-Type: delivery-status Media Type: message/global-delivery-
   status Registered By: [RFC6533] Section 6

6.3.  +gzip Media Type Suffix

   This document registers a new media type suffix "+gzip".  The GZIP
   format is a public domain, cross-platform, interoperable file storage
   and transfer format, specified in [RFC1952]; it supports compression
   and is used as the underlying representation by a variety of file
   formats.  The media type "application/gzip" has been registered for
   such files.  The suffix "+gzip" MAY be used with any media type whose
   representation follows that established for "application/gzip".  The
   media type structured syntax suffix registration form follows:

   Type name: GZIP file storage and transfer format

   +suffix: +gzip

   References: [RFC1952][RFC6713]

   Encoding considerations: GZIP is a binary encoding.

   Fragment identifier considerations: The syntax and semantics of
   fragment identifiers specified for +gzip SHOULD be as specified for
   "application/gzip".  (At publication of this document, there is no
   fragment identification syntax defined for "application/gzip".)  The
   syntax and semantics for fragment identifiers for a specific "xxx/
   yyy+gzip" SHOULD be processed as follows:

       For cases defined in +gzip, where the fragment identifier
       resolves per the +gzip rules, then process as specified in
       +gzip.

       For cases defined in +gzip, where the fragment identifier does
       not resolve per the +gzip rules, then process as specified in
       "xxx/yyy+gzip".

       For cases not defined in +gzip, then process as specified in
       "xxx/yyy+gzip".

   Interoperability considerations: n/a

   Security considerations: GZIP format doesn't provide confidentiality
   protection.  Integrity protection is provided by an Adler-32
   checksum, which is not cryptographically strong.  See also security
   considerations of [RFC6713].  Each individual media type registered
   with a +gzip suffix can have additional security considerations.
   Additionally, GZIP objects can contain multiple files and associated
   paths.  File paths must be validated when the files are extracted; a
   malicious file path could otherwise cause the extractor to overwrite
   application or system files.

7.  Security Considerations

   SMTP TLS Reporting provides transparency into misconfigurations or
   attempts to intercept or tamper with mail between hosts who support
   STARTTLS.  There are several security risks presented by the
   existence of this reporting channel:

   o  Flooding of the Aggregate report URI (rua) endpoint: An attacker
      could flood the endpoint with excessive reporting traffic and
      prevent the receiving domain from accepting additional reports.
      This type of Denial-of-Service attack would limit visibility into
      STARTTLS failures, leaving the receiving domain blind to an
      ongoing attack.

   o  Untrusted content: An attacker could inject malicious code into
      the report, opening a vulnerability in the receiving domain.
      Implementers are advised to take precautions against evaluating
      the contents of the report.




Margolis, et al.        Expires December 16, 2018              [Page 24]

Internet-Draft                 SMTP-TLSRPT                     June 2018


   o  Report snooping: An attacker could create a bogus TLSRPT record to
      receive statistics about a domain the attacker does not own.
      Since an attacker able to poison DNS is already able to receive
      counts of SMTP connections (and, absent DANE or MTA-STS policies,
      actual SMTP message payloads), this does not present a significant
      new vulnerability.

   o  Ignoring HTTPS validation when submitting reports: When reporting
      benign misconfigurations, it is likely that a misconfigured SMTP
      server may also mean a misconfigured HTTPS server; as a result,
      reporters who required HTTPS validity on the reporting endpoint
      may fail to alert administrators about such misconfigurations.
      Conversely, in the event of an actual attack, an attacker who
      wished to create a gap in reporting and could intercept HTTPS
      reports could, just as easily, simply thwart the resolution of the
      TLSRPT TXT record or establishment of the TCP session to the HTTPS
      endpoint.  Furthermore, such a man-in-the-middle attacker could
      discover most or all of the metadata exposed in a report merely
      through passive observation.  As a result, we consider the risks
      of failure to deliver reports on misconfigurations to outweigh
      those of attackers intercepting reports.

   o  Reports as DDoS: TLSRPT allows specifying destinations for the
      reports that are outside the authority of the Policy Domain, which
      allows domains to delegate processing of reports to a partner
      organization.  However, an attacker who controls the Policy Domain
      DNS could also use this mechanism to direct the reports to an
      unwitting victim, flooding that victim with excessive reports.
      DMARC [RFC7489] defines a solution for verifying delegation to
      avoid such attacks; the need for this is greater with DMARC,
      however, because DMARC allows an attacker to trigger reports to a
      target from an innocent third party by sending that third party
      mail (which triggers a report from the third party to the target).
      In the case of TLSRPT, the attacker would have to induce the third
      party to send the attacker mail in order to trigger reports from
      the third party to the victim; this reduces the risk of such an
      attack and the need for a verification mechanism.

   Finally, because TLSRPT is intended to help administrators discover
   man-in-the-middle attacks against transport-layer encryption,
   including attacks designed to thwart negotiation of encrypted
   connections (by downgrading opportunistic encryption or, in the case
   of MTA-STS, preventing discovery of a new MTA-STS policy), we must
   also consider the risk that an adversary who can induce such a
   downgrade attack can also prevent discovery of the TLSRPT TXT record
   (and thus prevent discovery of the successful downgrade attack).
   Administrators are thus encouraged to deploy TLSRPT TXT records with
   a large TTL (reducing the window for successful application of

   transient attacks against DNS resolution of the record) or to deploy
   DNSSEC on the deploying zone.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   MTAs are generally considered public knowledge, however, the
   internals of how those MTAs are configured and the users of those
   MTAs may not be as public.  It should be noted that when providing a
   receiving site with information, it may reveal information about the
   sender's configuration, or even information about the senders
   themselves.  Consider that by sending a report, it might disclose
   your SSL library version as the inability to negotiate a session may
   be a known incompatbility between two library versions, or perhaps
   commonly used in a operating system release that is centered in a
   certain region.  The risk may be minimal, but should be considered.
