                           SMTP TLS Reporting
                     draft-ietf-uta-smtp-tlsrpt-01

Abstract

   A number of protocols exist for establishing encrypted channels
   between SMTP Mail Transfer Agents, including STARTTLS [RFC3207], DANE
   [RFC6698], and SMTP MTA STS (TODO: Add ref).  These protocols can
   fail due to misconfiguration or active attack, leading to undelivered
   messages or delivery over unencrypted or unauthenticated channels.
   This document describes a reporting mechanism and format by which
   sending systems can share statistics and specific information about
   potential failures with recipient domains.  Recipient domains can
   then use this information to both detect potential attackers and
   diagnose unintentional misconfigurations.

1.  Introduction

   The STARTTLS extension to SMTP [RFC3207] allows SMTP clients and
   hosts to establish secure SMTP sessions over TLS.  The protocol
   design is based on "Opportunistic Security" (OS) [RFC7435], which
   provides interoperability for clients that do not support STARTTLS

   but means that any attacker who can delete parts of the SMTP session
   (such as the "250 STARTTLS" response) or redirect the entire SMTP
   session (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record of the
   delivery domain) can perform a downgrade or interception attack.

   Because such "downgrade attacks" are not necessarily apparent to the
   receiving MTA, this document defines a mechanism for sending domains
   to report on failures at multiple parts of the MTA-to-MTA
   conversation.

   Recipient domains may also use the mechanisms defined by MTA-STS
   (TODO: Add ref) or DANE [RFC6698] to publish additional encryption
   and authentication requirements; this document defines a mechanism
   for sending domains that are compatible with MTA-STS or DANE to share
   success and failure statistics with recipient domains.

   Specifically, this document defines a reporting schema that covers
   failures in routing, STARTTLS negotiation, and both DANE [RFC6698]
   and MTA-STS (TODO: Add ref) policy validation errors, and standard
   TXT record that recipient domains can use to indicate where reports
   in this format should be sent.

   This document is intended as a companion to the specification for
   SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS, TODO: Add ref).

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   We also define the following terms for further use in this document:

   o  STS Policy: A definition of the expected TLS availability and
      behavior, as well as the desired actions for a given domain when a
      sending MTA encounters different results.

   o  TLSRPT Policy: A policy detailing the endpoint to which sending
      MTAs should deliver reports.

   o  Policy Domain: The domain against which an STS Policy is defined.

   o  Sending MTA: The MTA initiating the delivery of an email message.

2.  Related Technologies

   o  This document is intended as a companion to the specification for
      SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS, TODO: Add ref).

   o  The Public Key Pinning Extension for HTTP [RFC7469] contains a
      JSON-based definition for reporting individual pin validation
      failures.

   o  The Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and
      Conformance (DMARC) [RFC7489] contains an XML-based reporting
      format for aggregate and detailed email delivery errors.

3.  Reporting Policy

   A report receiver pushishes a record to its DNS indicating that it
   wishes to receive reports.  These SMTP TLSRPT policies are
   distributed via DNS from the Policy Domain's zone, as TXT records
   (similar to DMARC policies) under the name "_smtp_tlsrpt".  For
   example, for the Policy Domain "example.com", the recipient's SMTP
   STS policy can be retrieved from "_smtp_tlsrpt.example.com".

   Policies consist of the following directives:

   o  "v": This value MUST be equal to "TLSRPTv1".

   o  "rua": A URI specifying the endpoint to which aggregate
      information about policy failures should be sent (see the section
      _Reporting_ _Schema_ for more information).  Two URI schemes are
      supported: "mailto" and "https".

 * In the case of `https`, reports should be submitted via POST
   ([@!RFC2818]) to the specified URI.
 * In the case of `mailto`, reports should be submitted to the specified
   email address. When sending failure reports via SMTP, sending MTAs
   MUST NOT honor SMTP STS or DANE TLSA failures.

   o  "ruf": Future use.  (There may also be a need for enabling more
      detailed "forensic" reporting during initial stages of a
      deployment.  To address this, the authors consider the possibility
      of an optional additional "forensic reporting mode" in which more
      details--such as certificate chains and MTA banners--may be
      reported.  See the section _Future_ _Work_ for more details.)

   The formal definition of the "_smtp_tlsrpt" TXT record, defined using
   [RFC5234], is as follows:

 tlsrpt-record       = tlsrpt-version *WSP %x3B tlsrpt-rua

 tlsrpt-version      = "v" *WSP "=" *WSP %x54 %x4C %x53
                       %x52 %x50 %x54 %x76 %x31

 tlsrpt-rua          = "rua" *WSP "=" *WSP tlsrpt-uri

 tlsrpt-uri          = URI
                     ; "URI" is imported from [@!RFC3986]; commas (ASCII
                     ; 0x2C) and exclamation points (ASCII 0x21)
                     ; MUST be encoded; the numeric portion MUST fit
                     ; within an unsigned 64-bit integer

4.  Reporting Schema

   The report is composed as a plain text file encoded in the JSON
   format ([RFC7159]).

   Aggregate reports contain the following fields:

   o  Report metadata:

      *  The organization responsible for the report

         +  Contact information for one or more responsible parties for
            the contents of the report

      *  A unique identifier for the report

      *  The reporting date range for the report

   o  Policy, consisting of:

      *  One of the following policy types:

         +  The SMTP MTA STS policy applied (as a string)

         +  The DANE TLSA record applied (as a string) * The literal
            string "no-policy-found", if neither a TLSA nor

                       MTA-STS policy could be found.

      *  The domain for which the policy is applied

      *  The MX host

      *  An identifier for the policy (where applicable)

Internet-Draft                 SMTP-TLSRPT                     July 2016


   o  Aggregate counts, comprising result type, sending MTA IP,
      receiving MTA hostname, message count, and an optional additional
      information field containing a URI for recipients to review
      further information on a failure type.

   Note that the failure types are non-exclusive; an aggregate report
   MAY contain overlapping "counts" of failure types where a single send
   attempt encountered multiple errors.

4.1.  Result Types

   The list of result types will start with the minimal set below, and
   is expected to grow over time based on real-world experience.  The
   initial set is:

4.1.1.  Success Type

   o  "success": This indicates that the sending MTA was able to
      successfully negotiate a policy-compliant TLS connection, and
      serves to provide a "heartbeat" to receiving domains that
      reporting is functional and tabulating correctly.

4.1.2.  Routing Failures

   o  "mx-mismatch": This indicates that the MX resolved for the
      recipient domain did not match the MX constraint specified in the
      policy.

   o  "certificate-host-mismatch": This indicates that the certificate
      presented by the receiving MX did not match the MX hostname.

4.1.3.  Negotiation Failures

   o  "starttls-not-supported": This indicates that the recipient MX did
      not support STARTTLS.

   o  "invalid-certificate": This indicates that the certificate
      presented by the receiving MX did not validate.

   o  "certificate-host-mismatch": This indicates that the certificate
      presented did not adhere to the constraints specified in the STS
      or DANE policy, e.g.  if the CN field did not match the hostname
      of the MX.

   o  "certificate-name-constraints-not-permitted": The certificate
      request contains a name that is not listed as permitted in the
      name constraints extension of the cert issuer.

Internet-Draft                 SMTP-TLSRPT                     July 2016


   o  "certificate-name-constraints-excluded": The certificate request
      contains a name that is listed as excluded in the name constraints
      extension of the issuer.

   o  "expired-certificate": This indicates that the certificate has
      expired.

4.1.4.  Policy Failures

4.1.4.1.  DANE-specific Policy Failures

   o  "tlsa-invalid": This indicates a validation error in the TLSA
      record associated with a DANE policy.

   o  "dnssec-invalid": This indicates a failure to authenticate DNS
      records for a Policy Domain with a published TLSA record.

4.1.4.2.  STS-specific Policy Failures

   o  "sts-invalid": This indicates a validation error for the overall
      MTA-STS policy.

   o  "webpki-invalid": This indicates that the MTA-STS policy could not
      be authenticated using PKIX validation.

5.  Report Delivery

   Reports can be delivered either as an email message via SMTP or via
   HTTP POST.

5.1.  Report Filename

   The filename is typically constructed using the following ABNF:


















Margolis, et al.         Expires January 9, 2017                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                 SMTP-TLSRPT                     July 2016


     filename = sender "!" policy-domain "!" begin-timestamp
                "!" end-timestamp [ "!" unique-id ] "." extension

      unique-id = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT)

      sender = domain
                 ; imported from [@!RFC5322]

      policy-domain   = domain

      begin-timestamp = 1*DIGIT
                        ; seconds since 00:00:00 UTC January 1, 1970
                        ; indicating start of the time range contained
                        ; in the report

      end-timestamp = 1*DIGIT
                      ; seconds since 00:00:00 UTC January 1, 1970
                      ; indicating end of the time range contained
                      ; in the report

      extension = "json" / "json.gz"

   The extension MUST be "json" for a plain JSON file, or "json.gz" for
   a JSON file compressed using GZIP.

   "unique-id" allows an optional unique ID generated by the Sending MTA
   to distinguish among multiple reports generated simultaneously by
   different sources within the same Policy Domain.  For example, this
   is a possible filename for the gzip file of a report to the Policy
   Domain "example.net" from the Sending MTA "mail.sender.example.com":

 `mail.sender.example.com!example.net!1470013207!1470186007!001.json.gz`

5.2.  Compression

   The report SHOULD be subjected to GZIP compression.  Declining to
   apply compression can cause the report to be too large for a receiver
   to process (a commonly observed receiver limit is ten megabytes);
   doing the compression increases the chances of acceptance of the
   report at some compute cost.

5.3.  Email Transport

   The report MAY be delivered by email.  No specific MIME message
   structure is required.  It is presumed that the aggregate reporting
   address will be equipped to extract MIME parts with the prescribed
   media type and filename and ignore the rest.




Margolis, et al.         Expires January 9, 2017                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                 SMTP-TLSRPT                     July 2016


   If compressed, the report should use the media type "application/
   gzip" if compressed (see [RFC6713]), and "text/json" otherwise.

   The [RFC5322].Subject field for individual report submissions SHOULD
   conform to the following ABNF:

     tlsrpt-subject = %x52.65.70.6f.72.74 1*FWS       ; "Report"
                      %x44.6f.6d.61.69.6e.3a 1*FWS    ; "Domain:"
                      domain-name 1*FWS               ; from RFC 6376
                      %x53.75.62.6d.69.74.74.65.72.3a ; "Submitter:"
                      1*FWS domain-name 1*FWS
                      %x52.65.70.6f.72.74.2d.49.44.3a ; "Report-ID:"
                      msg-id                          ; from RFC 5322

   The first domain-name indicates the DNS domain name about which the
   report was generated.  The second domain-name indicates the DNS
   domain name representing the Sending MTA generating the report.  The
   purpose of the Report-ID: portion of the field is to enable the
   Policy Domain to identify and ignore duplicate reports that might be
   sent by a Sending MTA.

   For instance, this is a possible Subject field for a report to the
   Policy Domain "example.net" from the Sending MTA
   "mail.sender.example.com".  It is line-wrapped as allowed by
   [RFC5322]:

            Subject: Report Domain: example.net
                Submitter: mail.sender.example.com
                Report-ID: <735ff.e317+bf22029@mailexample.net>

   Note that, when sending failure reports via SMTP, sending MTAs MUST
   NOT honor SMTP STS or DANE TLSA failures.

5.4.  HTTPS Transport

   The report MAY be delivered by POST to HTTPS.  If compressed, the
   report should use the media type "application/ gzip" if compressed
   (see [RFC6713]), and "text/json" otherwise.

6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations at this time.

7.  Security Considerations

   SMTP TLS Reporting provides transparency into misconfigurations or
   attempts to intercept or tamper with mail between hosts who support

   STARTTLS.  There are several security risks presented by the
   existence of this reporting channel:

   o  Flooding of the Aggregate report URI (rua) endpoint: An attacker
      could flood the endpoint and prevent the receiving domain from
      accepting additional reports.  This type of Denial-of-Service
      attack would limit visibility into STARTTLS failures, leaving the
      receiving domain blind to an ongoing attack.

   o  Untrusted content: An attacker could inject malicious code into
      the report, opening a vulnerability in the receiving domain.
      Implementers are advised to take precautions against evaluating
      the contents of the report.

   o  Report snooping: An attacker could create a bogus TLSRPT record to
      receive statistics about a domain the attacker does not own.
      Since an attacker able to poison DNS is already able to receive
      counts of SMTP connections (and, absent DANE or MTA-STS policies,
      actual SMTP message payloads) today, this does not present a
      significant new vulnerability.
