              SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS)
                       draft-ietf-uta-mta-sts-01

Abstract

   SMTP MTA-STS is a mechanism enabling mail service providers to
   declare their ability to receive TLS-secured connections, an
   expectated validity of certificates presented by their MX hosts, and
   to request that sending SMTP servers report upon and/or refuse to
   deliver messages that cannot be delivered securely.

1.  Introduction

   The STARTTLS extension to SMTP [RFC3207] allows SMTP clients and
   hosts to negotiate the use of a TLS channel for secure mail
   transmission.

   While such _opportunistic_ encryption protocols provide a high
   barrier against passive man-in-the-middle traffic interception, any
   attacker who can delete parts of the SMTP session (such as the "250
   STARTTLS" response) or who can redirect the entire SMTP session

   (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record of the delivery
   domain) can perform downgrade or interception attacks.

   This document defines a mechanism for recipient domains to publish
   policies specifying:

   o  whether MTAs sending mail to this domain can expect TLS support

   o  expected validity of server certificates presented by the domain's
      MX hosts

   o  what a conforming client should do with messages when TLS cannot
      be successfully negotiated

   The mechanism described is separated into four logical components:

   1.  policy semantics: whether senders can expect a server for the
       recipient domain to support TLS encryption

   2.  policy discovery & authentication: how to discover a domain's
       published policy

   3.  policy validation: how to authenticate the published policy

   4.  failure handling: what sending MTAs should do in the case of
       policy failures

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   We also define the following terms for further use in this document:

   o  STS Policy: A committment by the Policy Domain to support PKIX
      authenticated TLS for the specified MX hosts.

   o  Policy Domain: The domain for which an STS Policy is defined.
      (For example, when sending mail to "alice@example.com", the policy
      domain is "example.com".)

   o  Policy Authentication: Authentication of the STS policy retrieved
      for a recipient domain by the sender.

2.  Related Technologies

   The DANE TLSA record [RFC7672] is similar, in that DANE is also
   designed to upgrade opportunistic, unauthenticated encryption into
   required, authenticated encryption.  DANE requires DNSSEC [RFC4033]
   for authentication; the mechanism described here instead relies on
   certificate authorities (CAs) and does not require DNSSEC.  For a
   thorough discussion of this trade-off, see the section _Security_
   _Considerations_.

   In addition, SMTP MTA-STS provides an optional report-only mode,
   enabling soft deployments to detect policy failures.

3.  Policy Semantics

   SMTP MTA-STS policies are distributed via a "well known" HTTPS
   endpoint in the Policy Domain.  A corresponding TXT record in the DNS
   signals to sending MTAs the presence of a policy file.  The character
   content of the TXT record is encoded as US-ASCII.

   The MTA-STS TXT record MUST specify the following fields:

   o  "v": (plain-text, required).  Currently only "STSv1" is supported.

   o  "id": (plain-text, required).  A short string used to track policy
      updates.  This string MUST uniquely identify a given instance of a
      policy, such that senders can determine when the policy has been
      updated by comparing to the "id" of a previously seen policy.
      There is no implied ordering of "id" fields between revisions.

   Policies MUST specify the following fields in JSON [RFC4627] format:

   o  "version": (plain-text, required).  Currently only "STSv1" is
      supported.

   o  "mode": (plain-text, required).  Either "enforce" or "report",
      indicating the expected behavior of a sending MTA in the case of a
      policy validation failure.

   o  "mx": MX patterns (list of plain-text MX match patterns,
      required).  One or more patterns matching the expected MX for this
      domain.  For example, "["*.example.com", "*.example.net"]"
      indicates that mail for this domain might be handled by any MX
      with a hostname at "example.com" or "example.net".

   o  "max_age": Max lifetime of the policy (plain-text positive integer
      seconds).  Well-behaved clients SHOULD cache a policy for up to
      this value from last policy fetch time.

   A lenient parser SHOULD accept TXT record sand policy files which are
   syntactically valid (i.e. valid key-value pairs or valid JSON)
   implementing a superset of this specification, in which case unknown
   values SHALL be ignored.

3.1.  Formal Definition

3.1.1.  TXT Record

   An example TXT record is as below:

            _mta-sts  IN TXT ( "v=STSv1; id=20160831085700Z;" )

   The formal definition of the "_mta-sts" TXT record, defined using
   [RFC5234], is as follows:

      sts-text-record = sts-version *WSP %x3B *WSP sts-id

      sts-version     = "v" *WSP "=" *WSP %x53 %x54        ; "STSv1"
                        %x53 %x76 %x31

      sts-id          = "id" *WSP "=" *WSP 1*32(ALPHA / DIGIT)

3.1.2.  SMTP MTA-STS Policy

   An example policy is as below:

                      {
                        "version": "STSv1",
                        "mode": "enforce",
                        "mx": ["*.mail.example.com"],
                        "max_age": 123456
                      }

   The formal definition of the SMTP MTA-STS policy, using [RFC5234], is
   as follows:

                  1*dtext) %x22                      ; with 0+ more labels

dtext           = ALPHA / DIGIT / %2D                ; A-Z, a-z, 0-9, "-"

3.2.  Policy Expiration

   In order to resist attackers inserting a fraudulent policy, SMTP MTA-
   STS policies are designed to be long-lived, with an expiry typically
   greater than two weeks.  Policy validity is controlled by the
   lifetime indicated in the policy ("max_age=").  Senders SHOULD cache
   a policy (and apply it to all mail to the recipient domain) until the
   policy expiration.

   To mitigate the risks of long-lived cached policies (which otherwise
   may make it difficult for recipient domains to change infrastructure
   in ways which the policy forbids), domains can, at any time, publish
   an updated policy.  As described in _Policy_ _Application_, senders
   MUST fetch a new policy before treating a validation failure as a
   permanent delivery failure.

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                       July 2016


3.2.1.  Policy Updates

   Updating the policy requires that the owner make changes in two
   places: the "_mta-sts" TXT record in the Policy Domain's DNS zone and
   at the corresponding HTTPS endpoint.  In the case where the HTTPS
   endpoint has been updated but the TXT record has not been, senders
   will not know there is a new policy released and may thus continue to
   use old, previously cached versions.  Recipients should thus expect a
   policy will continue to be used by senders until both the HTTPS and
   TXT endpoints are updated and the TXT record's TTL has passed.

3.2.2.  Policy Revocation

   Senders MUST treat a policy with a max_age of 0 as a revocation: they
   should purge any previously cached policy and proceed to deliver mail
   to the recipient domain as though it never had an STS policy.

4.  Policy Discovery & Authentication

   Senders discover a recipient domain's MTA-STS policy by fetching a
   TXT record with the name generated by prefixing "_mta-sts" to the
   recipient domain.  A valid TXT record at "_mta-sts.example.com"
   indicates that the domain "example.com" supports MTA-STS.

   When sending to a recipient domain for which a valid TXT record
   exists, a compliant sender will then fetch via the GET method an
   HTTPS resource containing the policy body from a host at the "mta-
   sts" host of the policy domain, using an [RFC5785] "well-known" path
   of ".well-known/mta-sts.json".  For "example.com", this would be
   "https://mta-sts.example.com/.well-known/mta-sts.json".

4.1.  HTTPS Policy Fetching

   When fetching a new policy or updating a policy, the HTTPS endpoint
   MUST present a TLS certificate which is valid for the "mta-sts" host
   (as described in [RFC6125]), chain to a root CA that is trusted by
   the sending CA, and be non-expired.  It is expected that sending MTAs
   use a set of trusted CAs similar to those in widely deployed Web
   browsers and operating systems.

   HTTP 3xx redirects MUST NOT be followed.

   Senders may wish to rate-limit the frequency of attempts to fetch the
   HTTPS endpoint even if a valid TXT record for the recipient domain
   exists.  In the case that the HTTPS GET fails, we suggest
   implementions may limit further attempts to a period of five minutes
   or longer per version ID, to avoid overwhelming resource-constrained
   recipients with cascading failures.

4.2.  Policy Selection for Smart Hosts

   When sending mail via a "smart host"--an intermediate SMTP relay
   rather than the message recipient's server--compliant senders MUST
   treat the smart host domain as the policy domain for the purposes of
   policy discovery and application.

5.  Policy Validation

   When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid
   and non-expired SMTP MTA-STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP MTA-
   STS MUST validate:

   1.  That the recipient MX matches the "mx" pattern from the recipient
       domain's policy.

   2.  That the recipient MX supports STARTTLS and offers a valid PKIX
       based TLS certificate.

   This section does not dictate the behavior of sending MTAs when
   policies fail to validate; in particular, validation failures of
   policies which specify "report only" mode MUST NOT be interpreted as
   delivery failures, as described in the section _Policy_
   _Application_.

5.1.  MX Matching

   When delivering mail for the Policy Domain to a recipient MX host,
   the sender validates the MX match against the "mx" pattern from the
   applied policy.  The semantics for these patterns are those found in
   section 6.4 of [RFC6125].

   Patterns may contain a wildcard character "*" which matches any
   single domain name component or component fragment, though only as
   the leftmost component in a pattern.  For example, "*.example.com" is
   a valid pattern, but "foo.*.example.com" is not.  Given the pattern
   "*.example.com", "mx1.example.com" is a valid MX host, but
   "1234.dhcp.example.com" is not.

5.2.  MX Certificate Validation

   The certificate presented by the receiving MX MUST be valid for the
   MX hostname and chain to a root CA that is trusted by the sending
   MTA.  The certificate MUST have a CN or SAN matching the MX hostname
   (as described in [RFC6125]) and be non-expired.

   In the case of an "implicit" MX record (as specified in [RFC2821])
   where no MX RR exists for the recipient domain but there is an A RR,

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                       July 2016


   the MX hostname is assumed to be that of the A RR and should be
   validated as such.

6.  Policy Application

   When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid,
   non-expired STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP MTA-STS applies
   the result of a policy validation one of two ways, depending on the
   value of the policy "mode" field:

   1.  "report": In this mode, sending MTAs merely send a report (as
       described in the TLSRPT specification (TODO: add ref)) indicating
       policy application failures.  This can be used for "soft"
       deployments, to ensure a policy will not cause domain-wide mail
       delivery failures while being adopted or during infrastructure
       changes.

   2.  "enforce": In this mode, sending MTAs treat STS policy failures
       as a mail delivery error, and MUST NOT deliver the message to
       this host.  However, note that MTAs that honor "enforce" mode
       MUST first check for the existing of an updated, authenticated
       policy before _permanently_ failing messages.  This is to ensure
       that failures only occur if a sending MTA is in fact validating
       against the most recent version of the recipient domain's policy.

   Note that despite the presence of an "enforce" policy, STS-aware
   sending MTAs may in some cases choose to deliver mail to non-
   validating MXes due to external reasons, such as an inability to
   enforce STS at send-time (i.e., some domains may validate STS
   policies offline and only choose to report failures) or concerns
   about the completeness of their own trusted CA list.

   Finally, an STS Policy MUST NOT be be used to reject mail until it
   has been successfully validated when delivering at least one message
   to the Policy Domain.  This is to limit the risk of misconfigurations
   when deploying new policies.

6.1.  MX Preference

   When applying a policy, sending MTAs SHOULD select recipient MXs by
   first eliminating any MXs at lower priority than the current host (if
   in the MX candidate set), then eliminating any non-matching (as
   specified by the STS policy) MX hosts from the candidate MX set, and
   then attempting delivery to matching hosts as indicated by their MX
   priority, until delivery succeeds or the MX candidate set is empty.

   If none of the attempted MX hosts validate according to the policy,
   the policy MUST be refreshed at least once, as described in _Policy_

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                       July 2016


   _Discovery_ _&_ _Authentication_, before a message should be
   permanently rejected.  (In the case of policies in "report" mode, the
   sending MTA may simply fall back to the original candidate MX set.)

6.2.  Policy Application Control Flow

   The control flow for a sending MTA consists of the following steps:

   1.  Check for a cached, non-expired policy.  If none exists and the
       "_mta-sts" TXT record is present for the recipient domain, fetch
       a new policy, authenticate, and cache it.

   2.  Validate candidate MX or MXs against policy.  If a valid MX is
       discovered, deliver mail and mark cached policy as "successfully
       applied."

   3.  If no valid recipient MX is found, the cached policy mode is
       "enforce", and the cached policy has previously been successfully
       applied, temporarily fail the message.

   4.  Upon message retries, a message MAY be permanently failed
       following first checking for the presence of a new policy (as
       indicated by the "id" field in the "_mta-sts" TXT record).

7.  IANA Considerations

   A new .well-known URI will be registered in the Well-Known URIs
   registry as described below:

   URI Suffix: mta-sts.json Change Controller: IETF

8.  Security Considerations

   SMTP Strict Transport Security attempts to protect against an active
   attacker who wishes to intercept or tamper with mail between hosts
   who support STARTTLS.  There are two classes of attacks considered:

   1.  Foiling TLS negotiation, for example by deleting the "250
       STARTTLS" response from a server or altering TLS session
       negotiation.  This would result in the SMTP session occurring
       over plaintext, despite both parties supporting TLS.

   2.  Impersonating the destination mail server, whereby the sender
       might deliver the message to an impostor, who could then monitor
       and/or modify messages despite opportunistic TLS.  This
       impersonation could be accomplished by spoofing the DNS MX record
       for the recipient domain, or by redirecting client connections

       intended for the legitimate recipient server (for example, by
       altering BGP routing tables).

   SMTP Strict Transport Security relies on certificate validation via
   PKIX based TLS identity checking [RFC6125].  Attackers who are able
   to obtain a valid certificate for the targeted recipient mail service
   (e.g. by compromising a certificate authority) are thus able to
   circumvent STS authentication.

   Since we use DNS TXT record for policy discovery, an attacker who is
   able to block DNS responses can suppress the discovery of an STS
   Policy, making the Policy Domain appear not to have an STS Policy.
   The caching model described in _Policy_ _Expirations_ is designed to
   resist this attack.

   We additionally consider the Denial of Service risk posed by an
   attacker who can modify the DNS records for a victim domain.  Absent
   SMTP STS, such an attacker can cause a sending MTA to cache invalid
   MX records for a long TTL.  With SMTP STS, the attacker can
   additionally advertise a new SMTP STS policy with never-satisfied
   "mx" constraints and a long "max_age".

   This attack is mitigated in part by the ability of a victim domain to
   (at any time) publish a new policy updating or revoking the cached,
   malicious policy; this does, however, require the victim domain to
   both obtain a valid CA-signed certificate and to understand and
   properly configure SMTP STS.

   Similarly, we consider the possibilty of domains that deliberately
   allow untrusted users to serve untrusted content on user-specified
   subdomains.  In some cases (e.g. the service Tumblr.com) this takes
   the form of providing HTTPS hosting of user-registered subdomains; in
   other cases (e.g. dynamic DNS providers) this takes the form of
   allowing untrusted users to register custom DNS records at the
   provider's domain.

   In these cases, there is a risk that untrusted users would be able to
   serve custom content at the "mta-sts" host, including serving an
   illegitimate SMTP STS policy.  We believe this attack is mitigated in
   part by the need for the attacker to also serve the "_mta-sts" TXT
   record on the same domain--something not, to our knowledge, widely
   provided to untrusted users--and by the aforementioned ability for a
   victim domain to revoke an invalid policy at any future date.

   Even if an attacker cannot modify a served policy, the potential
   exists for configurations that allow attackers on the same domain to
   receive mail for that domain.  For example, an easy configuration
   option when authoring an STS Policy for "example.com" is to set the

   "mx" equal to "*.example.com"; recipient domains must consider in
   this case the risk that any user possessing a valid hostname and CA-
   signed certificate (for example, "dhcp-123.example.com") will, from
   the perspective of STS Policy validation, be a valid MX host for that
   domain.

10.  Appendix 1: Domain Owner STS example record

10.1.  Example 1

   The owner of "example.com" wishes to begin using STS with a policy
   that will solicit reports from receivers without affecting how the
   messages are processed, in order to verify the identity of MXs that
   handle mail for "example.com", confirm that TLS is correctly used,
   and ensure that certificates presented by the recipient MX validate.

   STS policy indicator TXT RR:

            _mta-sts  IN TXT ( "v=STSv1; id=20160831085700Z;" )

   STS Policy JSON served as the response body at [1]
