              SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS)
                       draft-ietf-uta-mta-sts-01

Abstract

   SMTP MTA-STS is a mechanism enabling mail service providers to
   declare their ability to receive TLS-secured connections, to declare
   particular methods for certificate validation, and to request that
   sending SMTP servers report upon and/or refuse to deliver messages
   that cannot be delivered securely.

1.  Introduction

   The STARTTLS extension to SMTP [RFC3207] allows SMTP clients and
   hosts to negotiate the use of a TLS channel for secure mail
   transmission.

   While such _opportunistic_ encryption protocols provide a high
   barrier against passive man-in-the-middle traffic interception, any
   attacker who can delete parts of the SMTP session (such as the "250
   STARTTLS" response) or who can redirect the entire SMTP session
   (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record of the delivery
   domain) can perform downgrade or interception attacks.

   This document defines a mechanism for recipient domains to publish
   policies specifying:

   o  whether MTAs sending mail to this domain can expect TLS support

   o  how to validate the names of the domain's MX hosts

   o  what a conforming client should do with messages when TLS cannot
      be successfully negotiated

   The mechanism described is separated into three logical components:

   1.  policy semantics: whether senders can expect a server for the
       recipient domain to support TLS encryption

   2.  policy discovery & authentication: how to discover a domain's
       published STS policy and determine the authenticity of that
       policy

   3.  failure handling: what sending MTAs should do in the case of
       policy failures

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   We also define the following terms for further use in this document:

   o  STS Policy: A definition of the expected TLS availability and
      behavior, as well as the desired actions for a given domain when a
      sending MTA encounters different results.

   o  Policy Domain: The domain against which an STS Policy is defined.
      (For example, when sending mail to "alice@example.com", the policy
      domain is "example.com".)

   o  Policy Authentication: Authentication of the STS policy retrieved
      for a recipient domain by the sender.

2.  Related Technologies

   The DANE TLSA record [RFC7672] is similar, in that DANE is also
   designed to upgrade opportunistic, unauthenticated encryption into
   required, authenticated encryption.  DANE requires DNSSEC [RFC4033]
   for authentication; the mechanism described here instead relies on
   certificate authorities (CAs) and does not require DNSSEC.

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                       July 2016


2.1.  Differences from DANE

   The primary difference between the mechanism described here and DANE
   is that DANE requires the use of DNSSEC to authenticate DANE TLSA
   records, whereas SMTP MTA-STS relies on the certificate authority
   (CA) system to avoid interception.  (For a thorough discussion of
   this trade-off, see the section _Security_ _Considerations_.)

   In addition, SMTP MTA-STS provides an optional report-only mode,
   enabling soft deployments to detect policy failures.

3.  Policy Semantics

   SMTP MTA-STS policies are distributed via a "well known" HTTPS
   endpoint in the Policy Domain.  A corresponding TXT record in the DNS
   signals to sending MTAs the presence of a policy file.  The character
   content of the TXT record is encoded as US-ASCII.

   *The MTA-STS TXT record MUST specify the following fields:*

   o  "v": (plain-text, required).  Currently only "STSv1" is supported.

   o  "id": (plain-text, required).  A short string used to track policy
      updates.  This string MUST uniquely identify a given instance of a
      policy, such that senders can determine when the policy has been
      updated by comparing to the "id" of a previously seen policy.

   *Policies MUST specify the following fields in JSON* [RFC4627]
   *format:*

   o  "version": (plain-text, required).  Currently only "STSv1" is
      supported.

   o  "mode": (plain-text, required).  If "enforce", the receiving MTA
      requests that messages be delivered only if they conform to the
      STS policy.  If "report" the receiving MTA requests that failure
      reports be delivered, as specified by the "rua" parameter.

   o  "mx": MX patterns (list of plain-text MX match patterns,
      required).  One or more comma-separated patterns matching the
      expected MX for this domain.  For example, "["*.example.com",
      "*.example.net"]" indicates that mail for this domain might be
      handled by any MX whose hostname is a subdomain of "example.com"
      or "example.net".  The semantics for these patterns should be the
      ones found in the "Checking of Wildcard Certificates" rules in
      Section 6.4.3 of [RFC6125].

   o  "max_age": Max lifetime of the policy (plain-text positive integer
      seconds).  Well-behaved clients SHOULD cache a policy for up to
      this value from last policy fetch time.

   A lenient parser SHOULD accept TXT record sand policy files which are
   syntactically valid (i.e. valid key-value pairs or valid JSON)
   implementing a superset of this specification, in which case unknown
   values SHALL be ignored.

3.1.  Formal Definition

3.1.1.  TXT Record

   An example TXT record is as below:

            _mta_sts  IN TXT ( "v=STSv1; id=20160831085700Z;" )

   The formal definition of the "_mta_sts" TXT record, defined using
   [RFC5234], is as follows:

      sts-text-record = sts-version *WSP %x3B *WSP sts-id

      sts-version     = "v" *WSP "=" *WSP %x53 %x54        ; "STSv1"
                        %x53 %x76 %x31

      sts-id          = "id" *WSP "=" *WSP 1*32(ALPHA / DIGIT)

3.1.2.  SMTP MTA-STS Policy

   An example policy is as below:

                      {
                        "version": "STSv1",
                        "mode": "enforce",
                        "mx": ["*.mail.example.com"],
                        "max_age": 123456
                      }

   The formal definition of the SMTP MTA-STS policy, using [RFC5234], is
   as follows:

dtext           = ALPHA / DIGIT / %2D                ; A-Z, a-z, 0-9, "-"

3.2.  Policy Expiration

   In order to resist attackers inserting a fraudulent policy, SMTP MTA-
   STS policies are designed to be long-lived, with an expiry typically
   greater than two weeks.  Policy validity is controlled by the
   lifetime indicated in the policy ("max_age=").  Senders SHOULD cache
   a policy (and apply it to all mail to the recipient domain) until the
   policy expiration.

   To mitigate the risks of long-lived cached policies (which otherwise
   may make it difficult for recipient domains to change infrastructure
   in ways which the policy forbids), domains can, at any time, publish
   an updated policy.  As described in _Policy_ _Application_, senders
   MUST fetch a new policy before treating a validation failure as a
   permanent delivery failure.






Margolis, et al.         Expires January 9, 2017                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                       July 2016


   Senders MUST treat a policy with a max_age of 0 as a revocation: they
   should purge any previously cached policy and proceed to deliver mail
   to the recipient domain as though it never had an STS policy.

3.2.1.  Policy Updates

   Updating the policy requires that the owner make changes in two
   places: the "_mta_sts" TXT record in the Policy Domain's DNS zone and
   at the corresponding HTTPS endpoint.  In the case where the HTTPS
   endpoint has been updated but the TXT record has not been, senders
   will not know there is a new policy released and may thus continue to
   use old, previously cached versions.  Recipients should thus expect a
   policy will continue to be used by senders until both the HTTPS and
   TXT endpoints are updated and the TXT record's TTL has passed.

3.3.  Policy Discovery & Authentication

   Senders discover a recipient domain's MTA-STS policy by fetching a
   TXT record from the recipient domain's DNS zone with the name
   "_mta_sts".  A valid TXT record at "_mta_sts.example.com" indicates
   that the domain "example.com" supports MTA-STS.

   When sending to a recipient domain for which a valid TXT record
   exists, a compliant sender will then fetch via the GET method an
   HTTPS resource containing the policy body from a host at the "mta-
   sts" host of the policy domain, using an [RFC5785] "well-known" path
   of ".well-known/mta-sts/current".  For "example.com", this would be
   "https://mta-sts.example.com/.well-known/mta-sts/current".

   When fetching a new policy or updating a policy, the HTTPS endpoint
   MUST present a TLS certificate which is valid for the "mta-sts" host
   (as described in [RFC6125]), chain to a root CA that is trusted by
   the sending CA, and be non-expired.

   HTTP 3xx redirects MUST NOT be followed.

   A policy which has not ever been successfully authenticated MUST NOT
   be used to reject mail.

   Senders may wish to rate-limit the frequency of attempts to fetch the
   HTTPS endpoint even if a valid TXT record for the recipient domain
   exists.  In the case that the HTTPS GET fails, we suggest
   implementions may limit further attempts to a period of five minutes
   or longer per version ID, to avoid overwhelming resource-constrained
   recipients with cascading failures.

3.4.  Policy Validation

   When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid
   and non-expired SMTP MTA-STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP MTA-
   STS MUST validate that the recipient MX matches the "mx" pattern from
   the recipient domain's policy, supports STARTTLS, and offers a valid
   PKIX based TLS certificate.  The certificate presented by the
   receiving MX MUST be valid for the MX name and chain to a root CA
   that is trusted by the sending MTA.  The certificate MUST have a CN
   or SAN matching the MX hostname (as described in [RFC6125]) and be
   non-expired.

   Note that this section does not dictate the behavior of sending MTAs
   when policies fail to validate; in particular, validation failures of
   policies which specify "report only" mode MUST NOT be interpreted as
   delivery failures, as described in the section _Policy_
   _Application_.

3.5.  Policy Application

   When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid,
   non-expired STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP MTA-STS applies
   the result of a policy validation one of two ways, depending on the
   value of the policy "mode" field:

   1.  "report": In this mode, sending MTAs merely send a report (as
       described in the "TLSRPT" specification (TODO: add ref))
       indicating policy application failures.  This can be used for
       "soft" deployments, to ensure a policy will not cause domain-wide
       mail delivery failures while being adopted or during
       infrastructure changes.

   2.  "enforce": In this mode, sending MTAs treat STS policy failures
       as a mail delivery error, and MUST NOT deliver the message to
       this host.  However, note that MTAs that honor "enforce" mode
       MUST first check for the existing of an updated, authenticated
       policy before _permanently_ failing messages.  This is to ensure
       that failures only occur if a sending MTA is in fact validating
       against the most recent version of the recipient domain's policy.

   Note that despite the presence of an "enforce" policy, STS-aware
   sending MTAs may in some cases choose to deliver mail to non-
   validating MXes due to external reasons, such as an inability to
   enforce STS at send-time (i.e., some domains may validate STS
   policies offline and only choose to report failures) or concerns
   about the completeness of their own trusted CA list.

3.5.1.  MX Preference in Enforce Mode

   When applying a policy specifying "enforce" mode, sending MTAs SHOULD
   select recipient MXs by first eliminating any MXs at lower priority
   than the current host (if in the MX candidate set), then eliminating
   any non-matching (as specified by the STS policy) MX hosts from the
   candidate MX set, and then attempting delivery to matching hosts as
   indicated by their MX priority, until delivery succeeds or the MX
   candidate set is empty.

   If none of the attempted MX hosts validate according to the policy,
   the policy MUST be refreshed at least once, as described in _Policy_
   _Discovery_ _&_ _Authentication_, before a message should be
   permanently rejected.

3.5.2.  Policy Application Control Flow

   The control flow for a sending MTA consists of the following steps:

   1.  Check for a cached, non-expired policy.  If none exists and the
       "_mta_sts" TXT record is present for the recipient domain, fetch
       a new policy, authenticate, and cache it.

   2.  Validate candidate MX or MXs against policy.  If a valid MX is
       discovered, deliver mail and mark cached policy as "successfully
       applied."

   3.  If no valid recipient MX is found, the cached policy mode is
       "reject", and the cached policy has previously been successfully
       applied, temporarily fail the message.

   4.  Upon message retries, a message MAY be permanently failed
       following first checking for the presence of a new policy (as
       indicated by the "id" field in the "_mta_sts" TXT record).

4.  IANA Considerations

   A new .well-known URI will be registered in the Well-Known URIs
   registry as described below:

   URI Suffix: mta-sts Change Controller: IETF

5.  Security Considerations

   SMTP Strict Transport Security attempts to protect against an active
   attacker who wishes to intercept or tamper with mail between hosts
   who support STARTTLS.  There are two classes of attacks considered:




Margolis, et al.         Expires January 9, 2017                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                       July 2016


   1.  Foiling TLS negotiation, for example by deleting the "250
       STARTTLS" response from a server or altering TLS session
       negotiation.  This would result in the SMTP session occurring
       over plaintext, despite both parties supporting TLS.

   2.  Impersonating the destination mail server, whereby the sender
       might deliver the message to an impostor, who could then monitor
       and/or modify messages despite opportunistic TLS.  This
       impersonation could be accomplished by spoofing the DNS MX record
       for the recipient domain, or by redirecting client connections
       intended for the legitimate recipient server (for example, by
       altering BGP routing tables).

   SMTP Strict Transport Security relies on certificate validation via
   PKIX based TLS identity checking [RFC6125].  Attackers who are able
   to obtain a valid certificate for the targeted recipient mail service
   (e.g. by compromising a certificate authority) are thus able to
   circumvent STS authentication.

   Since we use DNS TXT record for policy discovery, an attacker who is
   able to block DNS responses can suppress the discovery of an STS
   Policy, making the Policy Domain appear not to have an STS Policy.
   The caching model described in _Policy_ _Expirations_ is designed to
   resist this attack.

8.  Appendix 2: Domain Owner STS example record

8.1.  Example 1

   The owner of example.com wishes to begin using STS with a policy that
   will solicit aggregate feedback from receivers without affecting how
   the messages are processed, in order to:

   o  Verify the identity of MXs that handle mail for this domain

   o  Confirm that its legitimate messages are sent over TLS

   o  Verify the validity of the certificates

   o  Determine how many messages would be affected by a strict policy

   DNS STS policy indicator TXT record:

            _mta_sts  IN TXT ( "v=STSv1; id=20160831085700Z;" )

   STS policy served from HTTPS endpoint of the policy (recipient)
   domain, and is authenticated using the Web PKI mechanism.  The policy
   is fetched using HTTP GET method.

                      {
                        "version": "STSv1",
                        "mode": "report",
                        "mx": ["*.mail.example.com"],
                        "max_age": 123456
                      }
