                   SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security
                       draft-ietf-uta-mta-sts-01

Abstract

   SMTP MTA-STS is a mechanism enabling mail service providers to
   declare their ability to receive TLS-secured connections, to declare
   particular methods for certificate validation, and to request that
   sending SMTP servers report upon and/or refuse to deliver messages
   that cannot be delivered securely.

1.  Introduction

   The STARTTLS extension to SMTP [RFC3207] allows SMTP clients and
   hosts to establish negotiate the use of a TLS channel for secure mail
   transmission.

   While such _opportunistic_ encryption protocols provide a high
   barrier against passive man-in-the-middle traffic interception, any
   attacker who can delete parts of the SMTP session (such as the "250
   STARTTLS" response) or who can redirect the entire SMTP session
   (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record of the delivery
   domain) can perform downgrade or interception attacks.

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                       July 2016


   This document defines a mechanism for recipient domains to publish
   policies specifying:

   o  whether MTAs sending mail to this domain can expect TLS support

   o  how to validate the names of the domain's MX hosts

   o  what a conforming client should do with messages when TLS cannot
      be successfully negotiated

   The mechanism described is separated into three logical components:

   1.  policy semantics: whether senders can expect a server for the
       recipient domain to support TLS encryption

   2.  policy discovery & authentication: how to discover a domain's
       published STS policy and determine the authenticity of that
       policy

   3.  failure handling: what sending MTAs should do in the case of
       policy failures

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   We also define the following terms for further use in this document:

   o  STS Policy: A definition of the expected TLS availability and
      behavior, as well as the desired actions for a given domain when a
      sending MTA encounters different results.

   o  Policy Domain: The domain against which an STS Policy is defined.

   o  Policy Authentication: Authentication of the STS policy retrieved
      for a recipient domain by the sender.

2.  Related Technologies

   The DANE TLSA record [RFC7672] is similar, in that DANE is also
   designed to upgrade opportunistic encryption into required
   encryption.  DANE requires DNSSEC [RFC4033] for the secure delivery
   of policies; the mechanism described here presents a variant for
   systems not yet supporting DNSSEC.

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                       July 2016


2.1.  Differences from DANE

   The primary difference between the mechanism described here and DANE
   is that DANE requires the use of DNSSEC to authenticate DANE TLSA
   records, whereas SMTP STS relies on the certificate authority (CA)
   system to avoid interception.  (For a thorough discussion of this
   trade-off, see the section _Security_ _Considerations_.)

   In addition, SMTP MTA-STS introduces a mechanism for failure
   reporting and a report-only mode, enabling offline ("report-only")
   deployments and auditing for compliance.

2.1.1.  Advantages of SMTP MTA-STS when compared to DANE

   SMTP MTA-STS offers the following advantages compared to DANE:

   o  Infrastructure: In comparison to DANE, this proposal does not
      require DNSSEC be deployed on either the sending or receiving
      domain.  In addition, the reporting feature of SMTP MTA-STS can be
      deployed to perform offline analysis of STARTTLS failures,
      enabling mail providers to gain insight into the security of their
      SMTP connections without the need to modify MTA codebases
      directly.

   o  Offline or report-only usage: DANE does not provide a reporting
      mechanism and does not have a concept of "report-only" for
      failures; as a result, a service provider cannot receive metrics
      on TLS acceptability without asking senders to enforce a given
      policy; similarly, senders who cannot enforce DANE constraints at
      send-time have no mechanism to provide recipients such metrics
      from an offline (and potentially easier-to-deploy) logs-analysis
      batch process.

2.1.2.  Advantages of DANE when compared to SMTP MTA-STS

   o  Infrastructure: DANE may be easier for some providers to deploy.
      In particular, for providers who already support DNSSEC, SMTP MTA-
      STS would additionally require they host a HTTPS webserver and
      obtain a CA-signed X.509 certificate for the recipient domain.

   o  Security: DANE offers an advantage against policy-lookup DoS
      attacks; that is, while a DNSSEC-signed NXDOMAIN response to a
      DANE lookup authoritatively indicates the lack of a DANE record,
      such an option to authenticate policy non-existence does not exist
      when looking up a policy over plain DNS.

3.  Policy Semantics

   SMTP MTA-STS policies are distributed via a "well known" HTTPS
   endpoint in the Policy Domain.  A corresponding TXT record in the DNS
   alerts sending MTAs to the presence of a policy file.

   *The MTA-STS TXT record MUST specify the following fields:*

   o  "v": (plain-text, required).  Currently only "STSv1" is supported.

   o  "id": (plain-text, required).  A short string used to track policy
      updates.  This string MUST uniquely identify a given instance of a
      policy, such that senders can determine when the policy has been
      updated by comparing to the "id" of a previously seen policy, and
      must also match the "policy_id" value of the distributed policy.

   A lenient parser SHOULD accept a policy file implementing a superset
   of this specification, in which case unknown values SHALL be ignored.

   *Policies MUST specify the following fields in JSON* [RFC4627]
   *format:*

   o  "version": (plain-text, required).  Currently only "STSv1" is
      supported.

   o  "mode": (plain-text, required).  If "enforce", the receiving MTA
      requests that messages be delivered only if they conform to the
      STS policy.  If "report" the receiving MTA requests that failure
      reports be delivered, as specified by the "rua" parameter.

   o  "mx": MX patterns (list of plain-text MX match patterns,
      required).  One or more comma-separated patterns matching the
      expected MX for this domain.  For example, "["*.example.com",
      "*.example.net"]" indicates that mail for this domain might be
      handled by any MX whose hostname is a subdomain of "example.com"
      or "example.net".  The semantics for these patterns should be the
      ones found in the "Checking of Wildcard Certificates" rules in
      Section 6.4.3 of [RFC6125].

   o  "max_age": Max lifetime of the policy (plain-text integer
      seconds).  Well-behaved clients SHOULD cache a policy for up to
      this value from last policy fetch time.

   o  "policy_id": A short string used to track policy updates.  This
      string MUST uniquely identify a given instance of a policy, such
      that senders can determine when the policy has been updated by
      comparing to the "policy_id" of a previously seen policy.

   A lenient parser SHOULD accept a policy file which is valid JSON
   implementing a superset of this specification, in which case unknown
   values SHALL be ignored.

3.1.  Formal Definition

3.1.1.  TXT Record

   The formal definition of the "_mta_sts" TXT record, defined using
   [RFC5234], is as follows:

      sts-text-record = sts-version *WSP %x3B *WSP sts-id

      sts-version     = "v" *WSP "=" *WSP %x53 %x54        ; "STSv1"
                        %x53 %x76 %x31

      sts-id          = "id" *WSP "=" *WSP 1*32(ALPHA / DIGIT)

3.1.2.  SMTP MTA-STS Policy

   The formal definition of the SMTP MTA-STS policy, using [RFC5234], is
   as follows:

sts-record      = WSP %x7B WSP  ; { left curly bracket
                  sts-element   ; comma-separated
                  [             ; list
                  WSP %x2c WSP  ; of
                  sts-element   ; sts-elements
                  ]
                  WSP %x7d WSP  ; } right curly bracket

sts-element     = sts-version / sts-mode / sts-id / sts-mx / sts-max_age

sts-version     = %x22 "version" %x22 *WSP %x3a *WSP ; "version":
                  %x22 %x53 %x54 %x53 %x76 %x31      ; "STSv1"

sts-mode        = %x22 "mode" %x22 *WSP %x3a *WSP    ; "mode":
                  %x22 ("report" / "enforce") %x22   ; "report"/"enforce"

                  %x22 1*32(ALPHA / DIGIT) %x22        ; some chars

sts-mx          = %x22 "mx" $x22 *WSP %x3a *WSP      ; "mx":
                  %x5B                               ; [
                  domain-match                       ; comma-separated list
                  [WSP %x2c domain-match WSP]        ; of domain-matches
                  %x5B                               ; ]

sts-max_age     = %x22 "max_age" %x22 *WSP $x3a *WSP ; "max_age":
                  1*10DIGIT                          ; some digits

domain-match    = %x22 1*(dtext / "*") *("."         ; wildcard or label
                  1*dtext) %x22                      ; with 0+ more labels

dtext           = ALPHA / DIGIT / %2D                ; A-Z, a-z, 0-9, "-"

   A size limitation in a sts-uri, if provided, is interpreted as a
   count of units followed by an OPTIONAL unit size ("k" for kilobytes,
   "m" for megabytes, "g" for gigabytes, "t" for terabytes).  Without a
   unit, the number is presumed to be a basic byte count.  Note that the
   units are considered to be powers of two; a kilobyte is 2^10, a
   megabyte is 2^20, etc.

3.2.  Policy Expirations

   In order to resist attackers inserting a fraudulent policy, SMTP MTA-
   STS policies are designed to be long-lived, with an expiry typically
   greater than two weeks.  Policy validity is controlled by two
   separate expiration times: the lifetime indicated in the policy
   ("max_age=") and the TTL on the DNS record itself.  The policy
   expiration will ordinarily be longer than that of the DNS TTL, and



Margolis, et al.         Expires January 9, 2017                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                       July 2016


   senders SHOULD cache a policy (and apply it to all mail to the
   recipient domain) until the policy expiration.

   An important consideration for domains publishing a policy is that
   senders will see a policy expiration as relative to the fetch of a
   policy cached by their recursive resolver.  Consequently, a sender
   MAY treat a policy as valid for up to {expiration time} + {DNS TTL}.
   Publishers SHOULD thus continue to expect senders to apply old
   policies for up to this duration.

3.2.1.  Policy Updates

   Updating the policy requires that the owner make changes in two
   places: the "_mta_sts" RR record in the Policy Domain's DNS zone and
   at the corresponding HTTPS endpoint.  In the case where the HTTPS
   endpoint has been updated but the TXT record has not been, senders
   will not know there is a new policy released and may thus continue to
   use old, previously cached versions.  Recipients should thus expect a
   policy will continue to be used by senders until both the HTTPS and
   TXT endpoints are updated and the TXT record's TTL has passed.

3.3.  Policy Discovery & Authentication

   Senders discover a recipient domain's STS policy, by making an
   attempt to fetch TXT records from the recipient domain's DNS zone
   with the name "_mta_sts".  A valid TXT record presence in
   "_mta_sts.example.com" indicates that the recipent domain supports
   STS.  To allow recipient domains to safely serve new policies, it is
   important that senders are able to authenticate a new policy
   retrieved for a recipient domain.

   Web PKI is the mechanism used for policy authentication.  In this
   mechanism, the sender fetches a HTTPS resource (policy) from a host
   at "policy.mta-sts" in the Policy Domain.  The policy is served from
   a "well known" URI: "https://policy.mta-sts.example.com/.well-known/
   mta-sts/current".  To consider the policy as valid, the "policy_id"
   field in the policy MUST match the "id" field in the DNS TXT record
   under "_mta_sts".

   When fetching a new policy or updating a policy, the new policy MUST
   be fully authenticated (HTTPS certificate validation + peer
   verification) before use.  A policy which has not ever been
   successfully authenticated MUST NOT be used to reject mail.

3.4.  Policy Validation

   When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid
   and non-expired SMTP MTA-STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP MTA-
   STS MUST validate that the recipient MX supports STARTTLS, and offers
   a valid PKIX based TLS certificate.  The certificate presented by the
   receiving MX MUST be valid for the MX name and chain to a root CA
   that is trusted by the sending MTA.  The certificate MUST have a CN
   or SAN matching the MX hostname (as described in [RFC6125]) and be
   non-expired.

3.5.  Policy Application

   When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid
   non-expired SMTP MTA-STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP MTA-STS
   MAY apply the result of a policy validation one of two ways:

   o  "report": In this mode, sending MTAs merely send a report to the
      designated report address indicating policy application failures.
      This can be done "offline", i.e. based on the MTA logs, and is
      thus a suitable low-risk option for MTAs who wish to enhance
      transparency of TLS tampering without making complicated changes
      to production mail-handling infrastructure.

   o  "enforce": In this mode, sending MTAs SHOULD treat STS policy
      failures, in which the policy action is "reject", as a mail
      delivery error, and SHOULD terminate the SMTP connection, not
      delivering any more mail to the recipient MTA.

   In "enforce" mode, however, sending MTAs MUST first check for a new
   authenticated policy before actually treating a message failure as
   fatal.

   Thus the control flow for a sending MTA that does online policy
   application consists of the following steps:

   1.  Check for cached non-expired policy.  If none exists, fetch the
       latest, authenticate and cache it.

   2.  Validate recipient MTA against policy.  If valid, deliver mail.

   3.  If not valid and the policy specifies reporting, generate report.

   4.  If not valid and policy specifies rejection, perform the
       following steps:

       *  Check for a new (non-cached) authenticated policy.

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                       July 2016


       *  If one exists and the new policy is different, update the
          current policy and go to step 2.

       *  If one exists and the new policy is same as the cached policy,
          treat the delivery as a failure.

       *  If none exists and cached policy is not expired, treat the
          delivery as a failure.

   Understanding the details of step 4 is critical to understanding the
   behavior of the system as a whole.

   Remember that each policy has an expiration time (which SHOULD be
   long, on the order of days or months) and a validation method.  With
   these two mechanisms and the procedure specified in step 4,
   recipients who publish a policy have, in effect, a means of updating
   a cached policy at arbitrary intervals, without the risks (of a man-
   in-the-middle attack) they would incur if they were to shorten the
   policy expiration time.

4.  Failure Reporting

   Aggregate statistics on policy failures MAY be reported using the
   "TLSRPT" reporting specification (TODO: Add Ref).

5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations at this time.

6.  Security Considerations

   SMTP Strict Transport Security protects against an active attacker
   who wishes to intercept or tamper with mail between hosts who support
   STARTTLS.  There are two classes of attacks considered:

   o  Foiling TLS negotiation, for example by deleting the "250
      STARTTLS" response from a server or altering TLS session
      negotiation.  This would result in the SMTP session occurring over
      plaintext, despite both parties supporting TLS.

   o  Impersonating the destination mail server, whereby the sender
      might deliver the message to an impostor, who could then monitor
      and/or modify messages despite opportunistic TLS.  This
      impersonation could be accomplished by spoofing the DNS MX record
      for the recipient domain, or by redirecting client connections
      intended for the legitimate recipient server (for example, by
      altering BGP routing tables).

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                       July 2016


   SMTP Strict Transport Security relies on certificate validation via
   PKIX based TLS identity checking [RFC6125].  Attackers who are able
   to obtain a valid certificate for the targeted recipient mail service
   (e.g. by compromising a certificate authority) are thus out of scope
   of this threat model.

   Since we use DNS TXT record for policy discovery, an attacker who is
   able to block DNS responses can suppress the discovery of an STS
   Policy, making the Policy Domain appear not to have an STS Policy.
   The caching model described in _Policy_ _Expirations_ is designed to
   resist this attack.

9.  Appendix 2: Domain Owner STS example record

9.1.  Example 1

   The owner of example.com wishes to begin using STS with a policy that
   will solicit aggregate feedback from receivers without affecting how
   the messages are processed, in order to:

   o  Verify the identity of MXs that handle mail for this domain

   o  Confirm that its legitimate messages are sent over TLS

   o  Verify the validity of the certificates

   o  Determine how many messages would be affected by a strict policy

   DNS STS policy indicator TXT record:

               _mta_sts  IN TXT ( "v=STSv1; id=randomstr;" )

   STS policy served from HTTPS endpoint of the policy (recipient)
   domain, and is authenticated using Web PKI mechanism.  The policy is
   fetched using HTTP GET method.

                      {
                        "version": "STSv1",
                        "mode": "report",
                        "policy_id": "randomstr",
                        "mx": ["*.mail.example.com"],
                        "max_age": 123456
                      }

   The policy is authenticated using Web PKI mechanism.
