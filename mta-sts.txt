              SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS)
                       draft-ietf-uta-mta-sts-01

Abstract

   SMTP Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security (SMTP STS) is a
   mechanism enabling mail service providers to declare their ability to
   receive TLS-secured connections, an expectated validity of
   certificates presented by their MX hosts, and to request that sending
   SMTP servers report upon and/or refuse to deliver messages that
   cannot be delivered securely.

1.  Introduction

   The STARTTLS extension to SMTP [RFC3207] allows SMTP clients and
   hosts to negotiate the use of a TLS channel for secure mail
   transmission.

   While such _opportunistic_ encryption protocols provide a high
   barrier against passive man-in-the-middle traffic interception, any
   attacker who can delete parts of the SMTP session (such as the "250

   STARTTLS" response) or who can redirect the entire SMTP session
   (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record of the delivery
   domain) can perform downgrade or interception attacks.

   This document defines a mechanism for recipient domains to publish
   policies specifying:

   o  whether MTAs sending mail to this domain can expect TLS support

   o  expected validity of server certificates presented by the domain's
      MX hosts

   o  what a conforming client should do with messages when TLS cannot
      be successfully negotiated

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   We also define the following terms for further use in this document:

   o  STS Policy: A committment by the Policy Domain to support PKIX
      authenticated TLS for the specified MX hosts.

   o  Policy Domain: The domain for which an STS Policy is defined.
      (For example, when sending mail to "alice@example.com", the policy
      domain is "example.com".)

   o  Policy Authentication: Authentication of the STS policy retrieved
      for a recipient domain by the sender.

2.  Related Technologies

   The DANE TLSA record [RFC7672] is similar, in that DANE is also
   designed to upgrade opportunistic, unauthenticated encryption into
   required, authenticated encryption.  DANE requires DNSSEC [RFC4033]
   for authentication; the mechanism described here instead relies on
   certificate authorities (CAs) and does not require DNSSEC.  For a
   thorough discussion of this trade-off, see the section _Security_
   _Considerations_.

   In addition, SMTP STS provides an optional report-only mode, enabling
   soft deployments to detect policy failures.

3.  Overview

   SMTP STS policies are distributed via a "well-known" HTTPS endpoint
   in the Policy Domain, and their presence and versioning is indicated
   by way of a DNS record in the Policy Domain.  The definition of these
   policy URIs and the mechanism to discover, fetch, authenticate, and
   validate against policies is described in detail in the relevant
   following sections.

   Compliant MTAs implement long-lived policy caches and a mechanism to
   check for policy updates.  Thus when sending to an MTA at an external
   domain, a compliant MTA may:

   o  Already have a previously cached, unexpired policy for the
      recipient domain.

   o  Discover a new, not-yet-used policy for the recipient domain.

   One or both of these conditions may be true.  In order to allow
   recipient domains to both safely publish new policies and to allow
   new policies to take precedence over sender's cached policies while
   maintaining resilience against a denial of service against the policy
   discovery mechanism, we impose the following rules upon sender
   application of a policy:

   1.  A policy will only be cached if a message can successfully be
       delivered according to that policy.

   2.  A message will only be delivered if it validates against a cached
       (or to-be-cached) policy, or if no policy is present in the
       cache.

   These two rules confer the following properties:

   o  A misconfigured policy which is never satisfiable may cause a
      sender to deliver mail to the Policy Domain as though it has no
      MTA STS policy, but it will not cause mail delivery to fail.

   o  A sender can safely check for a new policy if delivery according
      to a cached policy fails.

   o  If a sender who has already discovered a working policy for a
      recipient domain should be unable to refresh the policy--due, for
      example, to an attacker who blocks DNS or HTTPS requests--the
      sender will fail "closed" and continue to apply the working
      policy.

   Below, we describe in detail the semantics of MTA-STS policies, and
   their discovery, authentication, and application.

4.  Policy Discovery

   SMTP STS policies are distributed via HTTPS from a "well-known" path
   served within the Policy Domain, and their presence and current
   version are indicated by a TXT record at the Policy Domain.  These
   TXT records additionally contain a policy "id" field, allowing
   sending MTAs to check the currency of a cached policy without
   performing an HTTPS request.

   Thus to discover if a recipient domain implements MTA-STS, a sender
   need only resolve a single TXT record; conversely, to see if an
   updated policy is available for a domain for which the sender has a
   previously cached policy, the sender need only check the TXT record's
   version "id" against the cached value.

4.1.  MTA-STS TXT Records

   The MTA-STS TXT record is a TXT record with the name "_mta-sts" at
   the Policy Domain.  For the domain "example.com", this record would
   be "_mta-sts.example.com".  MTA-STS TXT records MUST be US-ASCII,
   semicolon-separated key/value pairs containing the following fields:

   o  "v": (plain-text, required).  Currently only "STSv1" is supported.

   o  "id": (plain-text, required).  A short string used to track policy
      updates.  This string MUST uniquely identify a given instance of a
      policy, such that senders can determine when the policy has been
      updated by comparing to the "id" of a previously seen policy.
      There is no implied ordering of "id" fields between revisions.

   An example TXT record is as below:

   "_mta-sts IN TXT ( "v=STSv1; id=20160831085700Z;" )"

   The formal definition of the "_mta-sts" TXT record, defined using
   [RFC5234], is as follows:

      sts-text-record = sts-version *WSP %x3B *WSP sts-id

      sts-version     = "v" *WSP "=" *WSP %x53 %x54        ; "STSv1"
                        %x53 %x76 %x31

      sts-id          = "id" *WSP "=" *WSP 1*32(ALPHA / DIGIT)





Margolis, et al.         Expires January 9, 2017                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                       July 2016


   If multiple TXT records for "_mta-sts" are returned by the resolver,
   records which do not begin with "v=STSv1;" are discarded.  If the
   number of resulting records is not one, senders MUST assume the
   recipient domain does not implement MTA STS and skip the remaining
   steps of policy discovery.

4.2.  MTA-STS Policies

   The policy itself is a JSON [RFC4627] object served via the HTTPS GET
   method from the fixed [RFC5785] "well-known" path of ".well-known/
   mta-sts.json" served by the "mta-sts" host at the Policy Domain.
   Thus for "example.com" the path is "https://mta-sts.example.com
   /.well-known/mta-sts.json".

   This JSON object contains the following key/value pairs:

   o  "version": (plain-text, required).  Currently only "STSv1" is
      supported.

   o  "mode": (plain-text, required).  Either "enforce" or "report",
      indicating the expected behavior of a sending MTA in the case of a
      policy validation failure.

   o  "max_age": Max lifetime of the policy (plain-text non-negative
      integer seconds).  Well-behaved clients SHOULD cache a policy for
      up to this value from last policy fetch time.  To mitigate the
      risks of attacks at policy refresh time, it is expected that this
      value typically be in the range of weeks or greater.  A value of
      "0" indicates the policy should be revoked, and the sender should
      proceed as if the Policy Domain does not implement SMTP MTA-STS.

   o  "mx": MX patterns (list of plain-text MX match strings, required).
      One or more patterns matching the expected MX for this domain.
      For example, "["*.example.com", "*.example.net"]" indicates that
      mail for this domain might be handled by any MX with a hostname at
      "example.com" or "example.net".  Valid patterns can be either
      hostname literals (e.g. "mx1.example.com") or wildcard matches, so
      long as the wildcard occupies the full left-most label in the
      pattern.  (Thus "*.example.com" is valid but "mx*.example.com" is
      not.)

   An example JSON policy is as below:

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                       July 2016


                      {
                        "version": "STSv1",
                        "mode": "enforce",
                        "mx": ["*.mail.example.com"],
                        "max_age": 123456
                      }

   A lenient parser SHOULD accept TXT records and policy files which are
   syntactically valid (i.e. valid key-value pairs or valid JSON)
   implementing a superset of this specification, in which case unknown
   values SHALL be ignored.

4.3.  HTTPS Policy Fetching

   When fetching a new policy or updating a policy, the HTTPS endpoint
   MUST present a TLS certificate which is valid for the "mta-sts" host
   (as described in [RFC6125]), chain to a root CA that is trusted by
   the sending CA, and be non-expired.  It is expected that sending MTAs
   use a set of trusted CAs similar to those in widely deployed Web
   browsers and operating systems.

   HTTP 3xx redirects MUST NOT be followed.

   Senders may wish to rate-limit the frequency of attempts to fetch the
   HTTPS endpoint even if a valid TXT record for the recipient domain
   exists.  In the case that the HTTPS GET fails, we suggest
   implementions may limit further attempts to a period of five minutes
   or longer per version ID, to avoid overwhelming resource-constrained
   recipients with cascading failures.

4.4.  Policy Selection for Smart Hosts

   When sending mail via a "smart host"--an intermediate SMTP relay
   rather than the message recipient's server--compliant senders MUST
   treat the smart host domain as the policy domain for the purposes of
   policy discovery and application.

5.  Policy Validation

   When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid
   and non-expired SMTP MTA-STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP STS
   MUST validate:

   1.  That the recipient MX matches the "mx" pattern from the recipient
       domain's policy.

   2.  That the recipient MX supports STARTTLS and offers a valid PKIX
       based TLS certificate.

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                       July 2016


   This section does not dictate the behavior of sending MTAs when
   policies fail to validate; in particular, validation failures of
   policies which specify "report" mode MUST NOT be interpreted as
   delivery failures, as described in the section _Policy_
   _Application_.

5.1.  MX Matching

   When delivering mail for the Policy Domain to a recipient MX host,
   the sender validates the MX match against the "mx" pattern from the
   applied policy.  The semantics for these patterns are those found in
   section 6.4 of [RFC6125].

   Patterns may contain a wildcard character "*" which matches any
   single domain name component or component fragment, though only as
   the leftmost component in a pattern.  For example, "*.example.com" is
   a valid pattern, but "foo.*.example.com" is not.  Given the pattern
   "*.example.com", "mx1.example.com" is a valid MX host, but
   "1234.dhcp.example.com" is not.

5.2.  MX Certificate Validation

   The certificate presented by the receiving MX MUST be valid for the
   MX hostname and chain to a root CA that is trusted by the sending
   MTA.  The certificate MUST have a CN or SAN matching the MX hostname
   (as described in [RFC6125]) and be non-expired.

   In the case of an "implicit" MX record (as specified in [RFC2821])
   where no MX RR exists for the recipient domain but there is an A RR,
   the MX hostname is assumed to be that of the A RR and should be
   validated as such.

6.  Policy Application

   When sending to an MX at a domain for which the sender has a valid,
   non-expired STS policy, a sending MTA honoring SMTP STS applies the
   result of a policy validation one of two ways, depending on the value
   of the policy "mode" field:

   1.  "report": In this mode, sending MTAs merely send a report (as
       described in the TLSRPT specification (TODO: add ref)) indicating
       policy application failures.

   2.  "enforce": In this mode, sending MTAs treat STS policy failures
       as a mail delivery error, and MUST NOT deliver the message to
       this host if and only if the current policy version has
       previously been successfully applied when delivering at least one
       message to the Policy Domain.

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                       July 2016


   When a message fails to deliver due to an "enforce" policy, a
   compliant MTA MUST check for the presence of an updated policy at the
   Policy Domain before permanently failing to deliver the message.
   This allows implementing domains to update long-lived policies on the
   fly.

6.1.  MX Preference

   When applying a policy, sending MTAs SHOULD select recipient MXs by
   first eliminating any MXs at lower priority than the current host (if
   in the MX candidate set), then eliminating any non-matching (as
   specified by the STS Policy) MX hosts from the candidate MX set, and
   then attempting delivery to matching hosts as indicated by their MX
   priority, until delivery succeeds or the MX candidate set is empty.

6.2.  Policy Application Control Flow

   An example control flow for a compliant sender consists of the
   following steps:

   1.  Check for a cached, non-expired policy.  If none exists, attempt
       to fetch a new policy.  (Optionally, sending MTAs may
       unconditionally check for a new policy at this step.)

   2.  Filter candidate MXs against the policy or policies.  (If both a
       cached and a new policy are present, this will be the
       intersection of MXs allowed by either policy.)

   3.  If no candidate MXs are valid and the policy is from the policy
       cache with mode "enforce", temporarily fail the message.
       (Otherwise, generate a failure report but deliver as though MTA
       STS were not implemented.)

   4.  For each candidate MX, in order of MX priority, attempt to
       deliver the message, enforcing STARTTLS and the MX host's PKIX
       certificate validation.  If delivery succeeds and the MX is
       allowed by the new policy (if present), update the cache with the
       new policy.

   5.  Upon message retries, a message MAY be permanently failed
       following first checking for the presence of a new policy (as
       indicated by the "id" field in the "_mta-sts" TXT record).

   Alternative compliant implementations may also exist.  In particular,
   it may be easier to consider a "two-pass" implementation, in which a
   message is first attempted against a newly-fetched policy and, if
   unsuccessful, attempted again with the cached (or nil) policy.

7.  Operational Considerations

7.1.  Policy Updates

   Updating the policy requires that the owner make changes in two
   places: the "_mta-sts" TXT record in the Policy Domain's DNS zone and
   at the corresponding HTTPS endpoint.  In the case where the HTTPS
   endpoint has been updated but the TXT record has not yet been,
   senders will not know there is a new policy released and may thus
   continue to use old, previously cached versions.  Recipients should
   thus expect a policy will continue to be used by senders until both
   the HTTPS and TXT endpoints are updated and the TXT record's TTL has
   passed.

7.2.  Policy Versioning

   Because an STS Policy that has never before successfully been
   validated should not be used to reject mail, sending MTAs should
   consider the issue of maintaining multiple versions of a recipient
   domain's policy.

   When delivering a given message, a sending MTA may, for the recipient
   domain, posess a cached, previously validated (unexpired) policy
   _and/or_ a newly fetched, never-before-validated policy.

   During policy application, the sending MTA now has an option of which
   policy to apply; it is suggested that MTAs implement the following
   logic:

   o  If a new, unvalidated policy exists, attempt to deliver in
      compliance with this policy.  If this attempt succeeds _or_ the
      new policy mode is "report", mark the policy as "validated" and
      remove the previously cached policy.  (If the new policy has
      "max_age" equal to "0"--i.e., it is a revocation policy--delivery
      can proceed immediately, and the cache unconditionally purged.)

   o  If a new, unvalidated policy with mode set to "enforce" was
      attempted and failed to validate, deliver the message in
      compliance with the old, previously cached policy, and consider
      this a policy validation failure (for the purposes of TLSRPT
      (TODO: add reference)).

   Implementers may choose to think of this as a "two-pass" model
   (though such an implementation may be less efficient than a more
   optimized alternative):

   o  In the first pass, the new policy is attempted and, if successful,
      becomes the old policy.

   o  In the second pass, the old (or nil) policy is attempted, as would
      be the case if no new policy were found.

8.  IANA Considerations

   A new .well-known URI will be registered in the Well-Known URIs
   registry as described below:

9.  Security Considerations

   SMTP Strict Transport Security attempts to protect against an active
   attacker who wishes to intercept or tamper with mail between hosts
   who support STARTTLS.  There are two classes of attacks considered:

   1.  Foiling TLS negotiation, for example by deleting the "250
       STARTTLS" response from a server or altering TLS session
       negotiation.  This would result in the SMTP session occurring
       over plaintext, despite both parties supporting TLS.

   2.  Impersonating the destination mail server, whereby the sender
       might deliver the message to an impostor, who could then monitor
       and/or modify messages despite opportunistic TLS.  This
       impersonation could be accomplished by spoofing the DNS MX record
       for the recipient domain, or by redirecting client connections
       intended for the legitimate recipient server (for example, by
       altering BGP routing tables).

   SMTP Strict Transport Security relies on certificate validation via
   PKIX based TLS identity checking [RFC6125].  Attackers who are able
   to obtain a valid certificate for the targeted recipient mail service
   (e.g. by compromising a certificate authority) are thus able to
   circumvent STS authentication.

   Since we use DNS TXT records for policy discovery, an attacker who is
   able to block DNS responses can suppress the discovery of an STS
   Policy, making the Policy Domain appear not to have an STS Policy.
   The sender policy cache is designed to resist this attack.

   We additionally consider the Denial of Service risk posed by an
   attacker who can modify the DNS records for a victim domain.  Absent
   SMTP STS, such an attacker can cause a sending MTA to cache invalid
   MX records for a long TTL.  With SMTP STS, the attacker can
   additionally advertise a new, long-"max_age" SMTP STS policy with
   "mx" constraints that validate the malicious MX record, causing
   senders to cache the policy and refuse to deliver messages once the
   victim has resecured the MX records.

Internet-Draft                   MTA-STS                       July 2016


   This attack is mitigated in part by the ability of a victim domain to
   (at any time) publish a new policy updating or revoking the cached,
   malicious policy, though this does require the victim domain to both
   obtain a valid CA-signed certificate and to understand and properly
   configure SMTP STS.

   Similarly, we consider the possibilty of domains that deliberately
   allow untrusted users to serve untrusted content on user-specified
   subdomains.  In some cases (e.g. the service Tumblr.com) this takes
   the form of providing HTTPS hosting of user-registered subdomains; in
   other cases (e.g. dynamic DNS providers) this takes the form of
   allowing untrusted users to register custom DNS records at the
   provider's domain.

   In these cases, there is a risk that untrusted users would be able to
   serve custom content at the "mta-sts" host, including serving an
   illegitimate SMTP STS policy.  We believe this attack is rendered
   more difficult by the need for the attacker to both inject malicious
   (but temporarily working) MX records and also serve the "_mta-sts"
   TXT record on the same domain--something not, to our knowledge,
   widely provided to untrusted users.  This attack is additionally
   mitigated by the aforementioned ability for a victim domain to revoke
   an invalid policy at any future date.

   Even if an attacker cannot modify a served policy, the potential
   exists for configurations that allow attackers on the same domain to
   receive mail for that domain.  For example, an easy configuration
   option when authoring an STS Policy for "example.com" is to set the
   "mx" equal to "*.example.com"; recipient domains must consider in
   this case the risk that any user possessing a valid hostname and CA-
   signed certificate (for example, "dhcp-123.example.com") will, from
   the perspective of STS Policy validation, be a valid MX host for that
   domain.

11.  Appendix 1: Domain Owner STS example record

11.1.  Example 1

   The owner of "example.com" wishes to begin using STS with a policy
   that will solicit reports from receivers without affecting how the
   messages are processed, in order to verify the identity of MXs that
   handle mail for "example.com", confirm that TLS is correctly used,
   and ensure that certificates presented by the recipient MX validate.

   STS policy indicator TXT RR:

            _mta-sts  IN TXT ( "v=STSv1; id=20160831085700Z;" )

   STS Policy JSON served as the response body at [1]

              {
                "version": "STSv1",
                "mode": "report",
                "mx": ["mx1.example.com", "mx2.example.com"],
                "max_age": 123456
              }
