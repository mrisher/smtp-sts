<abstract>
<t>A number of protocols exist for establishing encrypted channels between SMTP
Mail Transfer Agents, including STARTTLS <xref target="RFC3207"/>, DANE <xref target="RFC6698"/>, and SMTP
MTA STS (TODO: Add ref). These protocols can fail due to misconfiguration or
active attack, leading to undelivered messages or delivery over unencrypted or
unauthenticated channels. This document describes a reporting mechanism and
format by which sending systems can share statistics and specific information
about potential failures with recipient domains. Recipient domains can then use
this information to both detect potential attackers and diagnose unintentional
misconfigurations.
</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>The STARTTLS extension to SMTP <xref target="RFC3207"/> allows SMTP clients and hosts to
establish secure SMTP sessions over TLS. The protocol design is based on
&quot;Opportunistic Security&quot; (OS) <xref target="RFC7435"/>, which provides interoperability for
clients that do not support STARTTLS but means that any attacker who can delete
parts of the SMTP session (such as the &quot;250 STARTTLS&quot; response) or redirect the
entire SMTP session (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record of the
delivery domain) can perform a downgrade or interception attack.
</t>
<t>Because such &quot;downgrade attacks&quot; are not necessarily apparent to the receiving
MTA, this document defines a mechanism for sending domains to report on failures
at multiple parts of the MTA-to-MTA conversation.
</t>
<t>Recipient domains may also use the mechanisms defined by MTA-STS (TODO: Add ref)
or DANE <xref target="RFC6698"/> to publish additional encryption and authentication
requirements; this document defines a mechanism for sending domains that are
compatible with MTA-STS or DANE to share success and failure statistics with
recipient domains.
</t>
<t>Specifically, this document defines a reporting schema that covers failures in
routing, STARTTLS negotiation, and both DANE <xref target="RFC6698"/> and MTA-STS (TODO: Add
ref) policy validation errors, and standard TXT record that recipient domains
can use to indicate where reports in this format should be sent.
</t>
<t>This document is intended as a companion to the specification for SMTP MTA
Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS, TODO: Add ref).

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>SMTP TLSRPT policies are distributed via DNS from the Policy Domain's zone, as
TXT records (similar to DMARC policies) under the name <spanx style="verb">_smtp-tlsrpt</spanx>. For
example, for the Policy Domain <spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx>, the recipient's SMTP STS policy
can be retrieved from <spanx style="verb">_smtp-tlsrpt.example.com</spanx>.

<figure align="center"><artwork align="center">
 * In the case of `https`, reports should be submitted via POST
   ([@!RFC2818]) to the specified URI.

   MUST NOT honor SMTP STS or DANE TLSA failures.

<t><spanx style="verb">ruf</spanx>: Future use. (There may also be a need for enabling more detailed
 &quot;forensic&quot; reporting during initial stages of a deployment. To address
 this, the authors consider the possibility of an optional additional
 &quot;forensic reporting mode&quot; in which more details--such as certificate chains
 and MTA banners--may be reported.)</t>

<t>SMTP TLS Reporting provides transparency into misconfigurations or attempts to
intercept or tamper with mail between hosts who support STARTTLS. There are
several security risks presented by the existence of this reporting channel:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Flooding of the Aggregate report URI (rua) endpoint: An attacker could
flood the endpoint and prevent the receiving domain from accepting
additional reports. This type of Denial-of-Service attack would limit
visibility into STARTTLS failures, leaving the receiving domain blind to an
ongoing attack.</t>
<t>Untrusted content: An attacker could inject malicious code into the
report, opening a vulnerability in the receiving domain. Implementers are
advised to take precautions against evaluating the contents of the report.</t>
<t>Report snooping: An attacker could create a bogus TLSRPT record to receive
statistics about a domain the attacker does not own. Since an attacker able
to poison DNS is already able to receive counts of SMTP connections (and,
absent DANE or MTA-STS policies, actual SMTP message payloads) today, this
does not present a significant new vulnerability.</t>
