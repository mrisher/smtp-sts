<abstract>
<t>A number of protocols exist for establishing encrypted channels between
SMTP Mail Transfer Agents, including STARTTLS, DANE TLSA, and MTA-STS.
These protocols can fail due to misconfiguration or active attack,
leading to undelivered messages or delivery over unencrypted or
unauthenticated channels.  This document describes a reporting mechanism
and format by which sending systems can share statistics and specific
information about potential failures with recipient domains. Recipient
domains can then use this information to both detect potential attacks and
diagnose unintentional misconfigurations.
</t>
</abstract>

<middle>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>The STARTTLS extension to SMTP <xref target="RFC3207"/> allows SMTP clients and hosts
to establish secure SMTP sessions over TLS. The protocol design uses an
approach that has come to be known as &quot;Opportunistic Security&quot; (OS)
<xref target="RFC7435"/>. This method maintains interoperability with clients that do
not support STARTTLS, but means that any attacker could potentially
eavesdrop on a session.  An attacker could perform a downgrade or
interception attack by deleting parts of the SMTP session (such as the
&quot;250 STARTTLS&quot; response) or redirect the entire SMTP session (perhaps
by overwriting the resolved MX record of the delivery domain).
</t>
<t>Because such &quot;downgrade attacks&quot; are not necessarily apparent to the
receiving MTA, this document defines a mechanism for sending domains to
report on failures at multiple stages of the MTA-to-MTA conversation.
</t>
<t>Recipient domains may also use the mechanisms defined by MTA-STS
<xref target="I-D.ietf-uta-mta-sts"/> or DANE <xref target="RFC6698"/> to
publish additional encryption and authentication requirements; this
document defines a mechanism for sending domains that are compatible
with MTA-STS or DANE to share success and failure statistics with
recipient domains.
</t>
<t>Specifically, this document defines a reporting schema that covers
failures in routing, DNS resolution, STARTTLS negotiation, and both
DANE <xref target="RFC6698"/> and MTA-STS <xref target="I-D.ietf-uta-mta-sts"/> policy validation
errors, and a standard TXT record that recipient domains can use to
indicate where reports in this format should be sent.  The report can
also serve as a heartbeat that systems are successfully negotiating
TLS during sessions as expected.
</t>
<t>This document is intended as a companion to the specification for SMTP
MTA Strict Transport Security <xref target="I-D.ietf-uta-mta-sts"/>, as well as adds
reporting abilities for those implementing DANE <xref target="RFC7672"/>.

</t>
<t>We also define the following terms for further use in this document:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>MTA-STS Policy: A mechanism by which administrators can specify the expected
TLS availability, presented identity, and desired actions for a given
email recipient domain. MTA-STS is defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-uta-mta-sts"/>.</t>
<t>DANE Policy: A mechanism by which administrators can use DNSSEC
to commit an MTA to support STARTTLS and to publish criteria to
be used to validate its presented certificates.  DANE for SMTP
is defined in [RFC7672], with the base specification in [RFC6698]
(updated in [RFC7671].</t>
<t>TLSRPT Policy: A policy specifying the endpoint to which sending MTAs
should deliver reports.</t>
<t>Policy Domain: The domain against which an MTA-STS or DANE Policy
is defined.  For MTA-STS this is typically the same as the envelope
recipient domain [RFC5321], but when mail is routed to a &quot;smarthost&quot;
gateway by local policy, the &quot;smarthost&quot; domain name is used instead.
For DANE the Policy Domain is the &quot;TLSA base domain&quot; of the receiving
SMTP server as described in <eref target="Section 2.2.3">RFC7672</eref> and <eref target="Section 3">RFC6698</eref>.</t>
<t>Sending MTA: The MTA initiating the relay of an email message.</t>
<t>Aggregate Report URI (rua): A comma-separated list of locations where
the report is to be submitted.</t>

<section anchor="reporting-policy" title="Reporting Policy">
<t>A domain publishes a record to its DNS indicating that it wishes to
receive reports. These SMTP TLSRPT policies are distributed via DNS from
the Policy Domain's zone, as TXT records (similar to DMARC policies)
under the name <spanx style="verb">_smtp._tls</spanx>. For example, for the Policy Domain
<spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx>, the recipient's TLSRPT policy can be retrieved from
<spanx style="verb">_smtp._tls.example.com</spanx>.
</t>
<t>Policies consist of the following directives:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t><spanx style="verb">v</spanx>: This document defines version 1 of TLSRPT, for which this value MUST be
equal to <spanx style="verb">TLSRPTv1</spanx>. Other versions may be defined in later documents.</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">rua</spanx>: A URI specifying the endpoint to which aggregate information
about policy validation results should be sent (see
<xref target="reporting-schema"/>, &quot;Reporting Schema&quot;,  for more information). Two
URI schemes are supported: <spanx style="verb">mailto</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">https</spanx>.  As with DMARC
<xref target="RFC7489"/>, the policy domain can specify a comma-separated list of
URIs.</t>
<t>In the case of <spanx style="verb">https</spanx>, reports should be submitted via POST
(<xref target="RFC7231"/>) to the specified URI.  Report submitters MAY ignore
certificate validation errors when submitting reports via https.</t>
<t>In the case of <spanx style="verb">mailto</spanx>, reports should be submitted to the specified email
address (<xref target="RFC6068"/>). When sending failure reports via SMTP, sending MTAs
MUST deliver reports despite any TLS-related failures and SHOULD NOT include
this SMTP session in the next report. When sending failure reports via HTTPS,
sending MTAs MAY deliver reports despite any TLS-related faliures. This may
mean that the reports are delivered in the clear. Reports sent via SMTP MUST
contain a valid DKIM <xref target="RFC6376"/> signature by the reporting domain. Reports
lacking such a signature MUST be ignored by the recipient.  DKIM signatures
must not use the &quot;l=&quot; attribute to limit the body length used in the
signature. The DKIM TXT record must contain the appropriate service type
declaration, <spanx style="verb">s=tlsrpt</spanx>, and if not present the receiving system SHOULD ignore
reports signed using this record.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>The formal definition of the <spanx style="verb">_smtp._tls</spanx> TXT record, defined using
<xref target="RFC5234"/> &amp; <xref target="RFC7405"/>, is as follows:
</t>

</artwork></figure>
<t>If multiple TXT records for <spanx style="verb">_smtp._tls</spanx> are returned by the resolver,
records which do not begin with <spanx style="verb">v=TLSRPTv1;</spanx> are discarded. If the
number of resulting records is not one, senders MUST assume the
recipient domain does not implement TLSRPT. If the resulting TXT record
contains multiple strings (as described in Section 3.1.3 of <xref target="RFC4408"/>),
then the record MUST be treated as if those strings are concatenated
together without adding spaces.
</t>
<t>The record supports the abillity to declare more than one rua, and if
there exists more than one, the reporter MAY attempt to deliver to
each of the supported rua destinations.  A receiver MAY opt to only
attempt delivery to one of the endpoints, however the report SHOULD NOT
be considered successfully delivered until one of the endpoints accepts
delivery of the report.
</t>
<t>Parsers MUST accept TXT records which are syntactically valid (i.e.
valid key-value pairs separated by semi-colons) and implementing a
superset of this specification, in which case unknown fields SHALL be
ignored.

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">
<t>SMTP TLS Reporting provides transparency into misconfigurations or
attempts to intercept or tamper with mail between hosts who support
STARTTLS. There are several security risks presented by the existence of
this reporting channel:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Flooding of the Aggregate report URI (rua) endpoint: An attacker could
flood the endpoint with excessive reporting traffic and prevent the
receiving domain from accepting additional reports. This type of
Denial-of-Service attack would limit visibility into STARTTLS
failures, leaving the receiving domain blind to an ongoing attack.</t>
<t>Untrusted content: An attacker could inject malicious code into the
report, opening a vulnerability in the receiving domain. Implementers
are advised to take precautions against evaluating the contents of the
report.</t>
<t>Report snooping: An attacker could create a bogus TLSRPT record to
receive statistics about a domain the attacker does not own. Since an
attacker able to poison DNS is already able to receive counts of SMTP
connections (and, absent DANE or MTA-STS policies, actual SMTP message
payloads), this does not present a significant new vulnerability.</t>
<t>Ignoring HTTPS validation when submitting reports: When reporting benign
misconfigurations, it is likely that a misconfigured SMTP server may also
mean a misconfigured HTTPS server; as a result, reporters who required
HTTPS validity on the reporting endpoint may fail to alert administrators
about such misconfigurations. Conversely, in the event of an actual attack,
an attacker who wished to create a gap in reporting and could intercept
HTTPS reports could, just as easily, simply thwart the resolution of the
TLSRPT TXT record or establishment of the TCP session to the HTTPS endpoint.
Furthermore, such a man-in-the-middle attacker could discover most or all of
the metadata exposed in a report merely through passive observation. As a
result, we consider the risks of failure to deliver reports on
misconfigurations to outweigh those of attackers intercepting reports.</t>
<t>Reports as DDoS: TLSRPT allows specifying destinations for the reports
that are outside the authority of the Policy Domain, which allows
domains to delegate processing of reports to a partner organization.
However, an attacker who controls the Policy Domain DNS could also use
this mechanism to direct the reports to an unwitting victim, flooding
that victim with excessive reports.  DMARC <xref target="RFC7489"/> defines a
solution for verifying delegation to avoid such attacks; the need for
this is greater with DMARC, however, because DMARC allows an attacker
to trigger reports to a target from an innocent third party by sending
that third party mail (which triggers a report from the third party to
the target).  In the case of TLSRPT, the attacker would have to induce
the third party to send the attacker mail in order to trigger reports
from the third party to the victim; this reduces the risk of such an
attack and the need for a verification mechanism.</t>

<t>Finally, because TLSRPT is intended to help administrators discover
man-in-the-middle attacks against transport-layer encryption, including
attacks designed to thwart negotiation of encrypted connections (by
downgrading opportunistic encryption or, in the case of MTA-STS,
preventing discovery of a new MTA-STS policy), we must also consider the
risk that an adversary who can induce such a downgrade attack can also
prevent discovery of the TLSRPT TXT record (and thus prevent discovery
of the successful downgrade attack). Administrators are thus encouraged
to deploy TLSRPT TXT records with a large TTL (reducing the window for
successful application of transient attacks against DNS resolution of the
record) or to deploy DNSSEC on the deploying zone.

<t>MTAs are generally considered public knowledge, however, the internals
of how those MTAs are configured and the users of those MTAs may not be
as public.  It should be noted that when providing a receiving site with
information, it may reveal information about the sender's configuration,
or even information about the senders themselves.  Consider that by sending
a report, it might disclose your SSL library version as the inability to
negotiate a session may be a known incompatbility between two library
versions, or perhaps commonly used in a operating system release that is
centered in a certain region. The risk may be minimal, but should be
considered.
