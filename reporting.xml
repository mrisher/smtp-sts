<abstract>
<t>A number of protocols exist for establishing encrypted channels between SMTP
Mail Transfer Agents, including STARTTLS <xref target="RFC3207"/>, DANE <xref target="RFC6698"/>, and SMTP
MTA STS (TODO: Add ref). These protocols can fail due to misconfiguration or
active attack, leading to undelivered messages or delivery over unencrypted or
unauthenticated channels. This document describes a reporting mechanism and
format by which sending systems can share statistics and specific information
about potential failures with recipient domains. Recipient domains can then use
this information to both detect potential attackers and diagnose unintentional
misconfigurations.
</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>The STARTTLS extension to SMTP <xref target="RFC3207"/> allows SMTP clients and hosts to
establish secure SMTP sessions over TLS. The protocol design is based on
&quot;Opportunistic Security&quot; (OS) <xref target="RFC7435"/>, which provides interoperability for
clients that do not support STARTTLS but means that any attacker who can delete
parts of the SMTP session (such as the &quot;250 STARTTLS&quot; response) or redirect the
entire SMTP session (perhaps by overwriting the resolved MX record of the
delivery domain) can perform a downgrade or interception attack.
</t>
<t>Because such &quot;downgrade attacks&quot; are not necessarily apparent to the receiving
MTA, this document defines a mechanism for sending domains to report on failures
at multiple parts of the MTA-to-MTA conversation.
</t>
<t>Recipient domains may also use the mechanisms defined by MTA-STS (TODO: Add ref)
or DANE <xref target="RFC6698"/> to publish additional encryption and authentication
requirements; this document defines a mechanism for sending domains that are
compatible with MTA-STS or DANE to share success and failure statistics with
recipient domains.
</t>
<t>Specifically, this document defines a reporting schema that covers failures in
routing, STARTTLS negotiation, and both DANE <xref target="RFC6698"/> and MTA-STS (TODO: Add
ref) policy validation errors, and standard TXT record that recipient domains
can use to indicate where reports in this format should be sent.
</t>
<t>This document is intended as a companion to the specification for SMTP MTA
Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS, TODO: Add ref).
</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
<t>The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT,
SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when
they appear in this document, are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.

<t>We also define the following terms for further use in this document:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>STS Policy: A definition of the expected TLS availability and behavior, as
well as the desired actions for a given domain when a sending MTA encounters
different results.</t>
<t>TLSRPT Policy: A policy detailing the endpoint to which sending MTAs should
deliver reports.</t>
<t>Policy Domain: The domain against which an STS Policy is defined.</t>
<t>Sending MTA: The MTA initiating the delivery of an email message.</t>

<t>The Public Key Pinning Extension for HTTP <xref target="RFC7469"/> contains a JSON-based

<section anchor="reporting-policy" title="Reporting Policy">
<t>A domain publishes a record to its DNS indicating that it wishes to
receive reports. These SMTP TLSRPT policies are distributed via DNS from the
Policy Domain's zone, as TXT records (similar to DMARC policies) under the name
<spanx style="verb">_smtp_tlsrpt</spanx>. For example, for the Policy Domain <spanx style="verb">example.com</spanx>, the
recipient's TLSRPT policy can be retrieved from <spanx style="verb">_smtp_tlsrpt.example.com</spanx>.
</t>
<t>Policies consist of the following directives:

<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t><spanx style="verb">v</spanx>: This value MUST be equal to <spanx style="verb">TLSRPTv1</spanx>.</t>

 policy failures should be sent (see the section <spanx style="emph">Reporting</spanx> <spanx style="emph">Schema</spanx> for
 more information). Two URI schemes are supported: <spanx style="verb">mailto</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">https</spanx>.
<list style="symbols">
<t>In the case of <spanx style="verb">https</spanx>, reports should be submitted via POST
   (<xref target="RFC2818"/>) to the specified URI.</t>
<t>In the case of <spanx style="verb">mailto</spanx>, reports should be submitted to the specified
   email address. When sending failure reports via SMTP, sending MTAs
   MUST NOT honor SMTP STS or DANE TLSA failures.</t>
</list></t>
<t><spanx style="verb">ruf</spanx>: Future use. (There may also be a need for enabling more detailed
 &quot;forensic&quot; reporting during initial stages of a deployment. To address
 this, the authors consider the possibility of an optional additional
 &quot;forensic reporting mode&quot; in which more details--such as certificate chains
 and MTA banners--may be reported.)</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>The formal definition of the <spanx style="verb">_smtp_tlsrpt</spanx> TXT record, defined using
<xref target="RFC5234"/>, is as follows:

                 ; in the report

 extension = "json" / "json.gz"
</artwork></figure>
<t>The extension MUST be &quot;json&quot; for a plain JSON file, or &quot;json.gz&quot; for a
   JSON file compressed using GZIP.
</t>
<t>&quot;unique-id&quot; allows an optional unique ID generated by the Sending MTA to
   distinguish among multiple reports generated simultaneously by different
   sources within the same Policy Domain. For example, this is a possible
   filename for the gzip file of a report to the Policy Domain &quot;example.net&quot;
   from the Sending MTA &quot;mail.sender.example.com&quot;:
</t>

<figure align="center"><artwork align="center">
 `mail.sender.example.com!example.net!1470013207!1470186007!001.json.gz`

</section>

<section anchor="compression" title="Compression">
<t>The report SHOULD be subjected to GZIP compression for both email and HTTPS
transport. Declining to apply compression can cause the report to be too large
for a receiver to process (a commonly observed receiver limit is ten megabytes);
doing the compression increases the chances of acceptance of the report at some
compute cost.
</t>
</section>

<section anchor="email-transport" title="Email Transport">
<t>The report MAY be delivered by email. No specific MIME message structure is
required. It is presumed that the aggregate reporting address will be equipped
to extract MIME parts with the prescribed media type and filename and ignore
the rest.
</t>
<t>If compressed, the report should use the media type <spanx style="verb">application/
gzip</spanx> if compressed (see <xref target="RFC6713"/>), and <spanx style="verb">text/json</spanx> otherwise.
</t>
<t>The <xref target="RFC5322"/>.Subject field for individual report submissions SHOULD

</artwork></figure>
<t>The first domain-name indicates the DNS domain name about which the
   report was generated.  The second domain-name indicates the DNS
   domain name representing the Sending MTA generating the report.
   The purpose of the Report-ID: portion of the field is to enable the
   Policy Domain to identify and ignore duplicate reports that might be
   sent by a Sending MTA.
</t>
<t>For instance, this is a possible Subject field for a report to the
   Policy Domain &quot;example.net&quot; from the Sending MTA
   &quot;mail.sender.example.com&quot;.  It is line-wrapped as allowed by <xref target="RFC5322"/>:

<t>SMTP TLS Reporting provides transparency into misconfigurations or attempts to

several security risks presented by the existence of this reporting channel:
</t>
<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Flooding of the Aggregate report URI (rua) endpoint: An attacker could
flood the endpoint and prevent the receiving domain from accepting
additional reports. This type of Denial-of-Service attack would limit
visibility into STARTTLS failures, leaving the receiving domain blind to an
ongoing attack.</t>
<t>Untrusted content: An attacker could inject malicious code into the
report, opening a vulnerability in the receiving domain. Implementers are
advised to take precautions against evaluating the contents of the report.</t>
<t>Report snooping: An attacker could create a bogus TLSRPT record to receive
statistics about a domain the attacker does not own. Since an attacker able
to poison DNS is already able to receive counts of SMTP connections (and,
absent DANE or MTA-STS policies, actual SMTP message payloads) today, this
does not present a significant new vulnerability.</t>
